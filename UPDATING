This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

  AFFECTS: users of python and net/samba410, devel/talloc, devel/tevent, databases/tdb, databases/ldb*
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  In the entry 20191216 for the Python update the filtering constrains
  are too limiting and omit the Samba supplimentary libraries, which do
  have Python bindings to the default Python 3.x version. With the update
  of the default Python3 version you also need to rebuild all the
  supplimentary Samba libraries and samba410 itself.

  For portmaster users it would be enough to run:

  # portmaster devel/talloc devel/tevent databases/tdb databases/ldb15 net/samba410


20200109:
  AFFECTS: www/firefox
  AUTHOR: gecko@FreeBSD.org

  Firefox requires Capsicum since r522464 for IPC and in future will
  require Capsicum for process sandboxing. If you use a custom kernel
  make sure to copy the following lines from GENERIC kernel:

    options 	CAPABILITY_MODE		# Capsicum capability mode
    options 	CAPABILITIES		# Capsicum capabilities

20200107:
  AFFECTS: Users of *-emacs27-* packages
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  There is a major version bump in 28.0.50, therefore to upgrade all the
  packages dependent on editors/emacs-devel, please use the following commands:

    # sh
    # for i in $(pkg query -g %n '*-emacs27*'); do \
        nn=$(echo "$i" | sed -e 's/emacs27/emacs28/'); \
        pkg set -yn "$i":"$nn"; done;
    # pkg upgrade

20200106:
  AFFECTS: users of net/gnatsd
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  net/gnatsd has been replaced by net/nats-server to reflect the
  new naming upstream.

  All options in rc.conf should be renamed by replacing 'gnats'
  with 'nats' (nats_enable, nats_user, nats_options).

20200101:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssl and security/openssl111
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The openssl port was removed on 2019-12-31, subsequently the openssl111
  port was renamed to openssl on 2020-01-01.

  The shared library version of OpenSSL has been bumped.

  Users of DEFAULT_VERSIONS= ssl=openssl111 must update this to
  ssl=openssl. 

  You must rebuild all ports that depend on OpenSSL if you use OpenSSL
  from ports.

20191226:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/dsbmd
  AUTHOR: mk@freeshell.de

  With version 1.10 dsbmd now uses sysutils/fusefs-jmtpfs for mounting
  MTP devices. Please adjust your dsbmd.conf or recreate it from the new
  dsbmd.conf.sample.

20191225:
  AFFECTS: multimedia/libva-intel-media-driver
  AUTHOR: jbeich@FreeBSD.org

  As of libva 2.6.0 iHD driver is automatically enabled, so you no
  longer need to adjust LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME in ~/.profile or ~/.login.

20191221:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/openhab2
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  If you upgrade from a pevious version, make a backup of
        /var/db/openhab2
  read about the breaking changes in the release notes at
        https://github.com/openhab/openhab-distro/releases/tag/2.5.0
  and run
        %%PREFIX%%/libexec/openhab2/runtime/bin/update.freebsd
  which takes care about changes for:
        - Textual Configuration
        - Next Generation Rule Engine

20191216:
  AFFECTS: users of python
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  Default version of python3 and python was switched to 3.7.

  For ports users wanting to keep version 3.6 as default,
  add DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= python=3.6 python3=3.6 to make.conf

  This may ease the upgrade for users of pre-build packages:
  # sh
  # for i in $(pkg query -g %n 'py36-*'); do pkg set -yn ${i}:py37-${i#py36-}; done
  # pkg upgrade

  For portmaster users:
  # portmaster -o lang/python37 python36
  # REINSTALL="$(pkg info -o py36-\* | awk '{printf "%s ", $2}')"
  # pkg delete -f py36-\*
  # portmaster $REINSTALL
  # REBUILD=$(pkg query -g "%n:%dn" '*' | grep py3 | grep -v py37 | cut -d : -f 1 | sort -u)
  # portmaster $REBUILD

20191204
  AFFECTS: users of mail/nextcloud-mail
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  Version 0.20.0 removed the default mail configuration via config.php.
  All users will be prompted to enter account and SMTP- and IMAP-server
  details for sending and reading email.

20191126:
  AFFECTS: consumers of net/py-urllib3
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Since version 1.25 HTTPS connections are now verified by default which is
  done via "cert_reqs = 'CERT_REQUIRED'".  While certificate verification
  can be disabled via "cert_reqs = 'CERT_NONE'", it's highly recommended to
  leave it on.

  Various consumers of net/py-urllib3 already have implemented routines that
  either explicitly enable or disable HTTPS certificate verification (e.g.
  via configuration settings, CLI arguments, etc.).

  Yet it may happen that there are still some consumers which don't
  explicitly enable/disable certificate verification for HTTPS connections
  which could then lead to errors (as is often the case with self-signed
  certificates).

  In case of an error one should try first to temporarily disable
  certificate verification of the problematic urllib3 consumer to see if
  this approach will remedy the issue.

20191125:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  emulators/qemu31 has been updated to 4.1.1. Previous 3.1.X branch has 
  been repocopied to emulators/qemu31. If someone wants to stick with 3.1.X
  branch please use one of the following command:

  # pkg install emulators/qemu31
    or
  # portmaster -o emulators/qemu31 emulators/qemu
    or
  # portupgrade -o emulators/qemu31 emulators/qemu

20191124:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/eggdrop
  AUTHOR: dbaio@FreeBSD.org

  The irc/eggdrop port has been updated to 1.8.4 and its config is not
  backward compatible with 1.6.21. A new port was created to keep 1.6.21
  version available at irc/eggdrop16 and it will be available for 3 months
  until users have time to upgrade their configuration.

  More information at:
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eggheads/eggdrop/v1.8.4/NEWS

  If you would like to keep using 1.6.21, please run the following command
  to update pkg database:

    pkg set -n eggdrop:eggdrop16
    pkg set -o irc/eggdrop:irc/eggdrop16

20191108:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/redis[-devel]
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/redis port has been updated to the recent stable release.
  Users wanting to stay on v4.x can replace databases/redis with 
  databases/redis4 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg install databases/redis4
    or
  # portmaster -o databases/redis4 databases/redis
    or
  # portupgrade -o databases/redis4 databases/redis

20191103:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The www/node port has been updated to Node.js v13.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. A new port, www/node12, has been created for the
  v12.x LTS branch. Users wanting to stay on v12.x can replace www/node
  with www/node12 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg install www/node12
    or
  # portmaster -o www/node12 www/node
    or
  # portupgrade -o www/node12 www/node

20191029:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/open-vm-tools[-nox11]
  AUTHOR: jpaetzel@FreeBSD.org

open-vm-tools 11.0.1 has removed the vmxnet driver.  This driver has been
in tree for quite some time and hopefully everyone is using the in tree
version, however if you had removed device vmx from your kernel, or are
running an unsupported version of FreeBSD which didn't have the driver
included in the base system, updating your open-vm-tools version will
leave you without networking.

20191026:
  AFFECTS: users of www/qt5-webengine
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Users that upgrade www/qt5-webengine without using pkg/poudriere might
  experience failures due to conflicts with the installed version of 5.12.2.

  In that case, pkg delete -f the qt5-webengine package before building
  the updated version.

20191025:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/nvidia-driver (and slave ports)
  AUTHOR: danfe@FreeBSD.org

  x11/nvidia-driver* ports no longer install Linux programs and libraries,
  which had been moved to their own ports (x11/linux-nvidia-libs*).  When
  updating the driver package next time, remember to install them manually
  if you need to run Linux OpenGL programs.

20191016:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE Plasma Desktop (x11/plasma5*)
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  With Plasma 5.17 the startup script has been renamed. People who use the
  .xinitrc method to start Plasma have to call the new binary.

  Previously:
  	exec ck-launch-session startkde
  Change to:
  	exec ck-launch-session startplasma-x11

20191014:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/rspamd, mail/rspamd-devel
  AUTHOR: vsevolod@FreeBSD.org

  Sample configuration files has been removed as default configuration files
  are NOT intended for modification by users and SHOULD be overwritten on
  port upgrade.

  Make sure the default configuration files are unmodified and migrate all
  configuration changes to the proper places, before you continue.

20191002:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/groff
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  with groff 1.2.4_3, groff does not depend anymore on ghostscript and
  netpbm. In order to be able to properly use the html backend the user
  can install ghostscript and netpbm from ports without the need of
  reinstalling the package.

  Also note that the X11 option has been removed.

20190930:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Since the 2.6 release a running Redis server instance is required for
  caching objects to run.  Also the following settings like below need to be
  added (or modified) in the existing configuration.py:

  REDIS = {
    'HOST': 'localhost',
    'PORT': 6397,
    'PASSWORD': ''
    'DATABASE': 0,
    'CACHE_DATABASE': 1,
    'DEFAULT_TIMEOUT': 300,
    'SSL': False,
  }

  Note that if you were using these settings in a prior release with
  webhooks, the DATABASE setting remains the same but an additional
  CACHE_DATABASE settings has been added with a default value of 1 to
  support the caching backend.

  The DATABASE setting will be renamed in a future release of NetBox to
  better relay the meaning of the setting.  It is highly recommended to keep
  the webhook and cache databases separate.  Using the same database number
  for both may result in webhook processing data being lost during cache
  flushing events.

  Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20190927:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu-devel
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  qemu-devel has been updated to 4.1.0 and 4.0.0 has been merged into a new port
  emulators/qemu40. If you want to stick with 4.0.X branch, simply use:
  # portmaster -o emulators/qemu-devel emulators/qemu40

20190927:
  AFFECTS: users of XFCE desktop (x11-wm/xfce4)
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Due to changes in the XFCE 4.14 metaport, systems could end up with
  both xscreensaver and xfce4-screensaver installed and enabled
  simultaneously.

  This can cause conflicts and problems unlocking the screen.

  To avoid problems, please make sure to have only one enabled by
  going to the Application Autostart tab of the Session and Startup
  settings applet and enable only one Screensaver there.

  Some further information can be found in the xfce4-session
  pkg-message displayed on installation and upgrade.

20190920:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/pushgateway
  AUTHOR: 0mp@FreeBSD.org

  The persistent storage format used by pushgateway in the latest version
  is not backwards compatible. See the pushgateway changelogs for details.

20190911:
  AFFECTS: users of security/bastillion
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The datastore of bastillion needs to be updated:
    java -jar $PREFIX/jetty_bastillion/upgrade/bastillion-upgrade-3.08.00.jar \
      $PREFIX/jetty_bastillion/bastillion/WEB-INF/classes/BastillionConfig.properties

20190909:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby25
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.5 to 2.6.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.5 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.5 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.5

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you do not use pkg, please check entry 20190420.
  The description there should also work for this version.

20190906:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/py-fabric
  AUTHOR: dbaio@FreeBSD.org

  Fabric (devel/py-fabric) was upgraded to 2.5.0, Fabric (2+) represents
  a near-total reimplementation and reorganization of the software.

  Fabric 2 is not at 100% feature parity with 1.x! Some features have been
  explicitly dropped, but others simply have not been ported over yet,
  either due to time constraints or because said features need to be
  re-examined in a modern context.

  More information at:
  https://www.fabfile.org/upgrading.html#upgrading
  https://www.fabfile.org/upgrading.html#upgrade-specifics

  If you would like to keep using 1.x, please run the following command to
  update pkg database:

    pkg set -n py27-fabric:py27-fabric1
    pkg set -o devel/py-fabric:devel/py-fabric1

20190830:
  AFFECTS: users of www/gitlab-ce
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  Make sure you upgrade your PostgreSQL to version 11 as described in 20190829,
  before you upgrade your gitlab-ce version.
  Gitlab-ce 12.1 needs at least PostgreSQL version 9.6.

  After this you can follow the usual upgrade guide:
  https://gitlab.fechner.net/mfechner/Gitlab-docu/blob/master/update/12.0-12.1-freebsd.md

20190829:
  AFFECTS: users of database/postgresql* and other software using PostgreSQL to run
  AUTHOR: tz@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PostgreSQL has been switched from 9.5 to 11.
  The upgrade procedure can use up twice the space the databases
  currently needs. If you have a big amount of stored data take a
  closer look at the manpage of pg_upgrade for avoidance and/or
  speedup of the upgrade.

  The upgrade instructions consider a basic usage and do not match
  complex scenarios like replication, sharding, or similar.

  Upgrade instructions:

  First stop your PostgreSQL, create PostgreSQL-binaries and backup your data.
  If you have another Version of PostgreSQL installed, for example 9.5.19, your
  files are named according to this.

  # service postgresql stop
  # pkg create postgresql95-server postgresql95-contrib
  # mkdir /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql95-server-9.5.19.txz -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql95-contrib-9.5.19.txz -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # pkg delete -f databases/postgresql95-server databases/postgresql95-contrib databases/postgresql95-client

  Now update PostgreSQL:

    pkg user:
    # pkg install databases/postgresql11-server databases/postgresql11-contrib
    # pkg upgrade

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster databases/postgresql11-server databases/postgresql11-contrib
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall databases/postgresql11-server databases/postgresql11-contrib
    # portupgrade -a

  After installing the new PostgreSQL version you need to convert
  all your databases to new version:

  # su -l postgres -c "/usr/local/bin/initdb --encoding=utf-8 --lc-collate=C -D /var/db/postgres/data11 -U pgsql"
  # chown -R postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data/
  # su -l postgres -c "pg_upgrade -b /tmp/pg-upgrade/usr/local/bin/ -d /usr/local/pgsql/data/ -B /usr/local/bin/ -D /var/db/postgres/data11/ -U pgsql "

  Now the migration is finished. You can start PostgreSQL again with:

  # service postgresql start

  ATTENTION:
  1) The default user changed from "pgsql" to "postgres". The migration steps above preserve
     the "pgsql" database user while the database daemon is now executed as the "postgres" FreeBSD user.
  2) The default data dir changed from "/usr/local/pgsql/data/" to "/var/db/postgres/data11/"
  3) If you use non-default initdb options, you have to adjust the initdb-command accordingly

20190816:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/ejabberd
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  Riak support has been removed by upstream. For update instructions from
  19.05, please refer to:

  https://docs.ejabberd.im/admin/upgrade/from_19.05_to_19.08/

20190812:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The default Perl version has been switched to Perl 5.30.  If you are using
  binary packages to upgrade your system, you do not have anything to do, pkg
  upgrade will do the right thing.  For the other people, follow the
  instructions in entry 20161103, it should still be the same.

20190801:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ot-recorder
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  The data directory has moved from /var/spool/owntracks to
  /var/db/owntracks

  Be sure to stop otrecorder, move the directory, and start otrecorder.

  service ot-recorder stop
  cd /var/spool
  mv owntracks /var/db
  service ot-recorder start

20190728:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/py-matrix-synapse
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  The support for Python 2.7 has been dropped with the 1.1.0 release of
  net/py-matrix-synapse.

  Users that still use the Python 2.7 version of net-im/py-matrix-synapse
  should switch to a newer Python version, e.g. 3.6, which is the default
  Python version since April 2019.

20190717:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/zetacoin and net-p2p/zetacoin-nox11
  AUTHOR: daniel@morante.net

  Zetacoin will default to using modern versions of BDB (5.x or 6.x) when
  the WALLET option is selected.   See pkg-help for explanation.

  The zetacoin-nox11 slave port was renamed to zetacoin-daemon to align
  with the net-p2p/bitcoin format.

  The zetacoin-cli and zetacoin-tx utilities have been re-packaged into
  a separate port. If you require these programs, or use the zetacoin-cli
  program to access the daemon or the GUI, install net-p2p/zetacoin-utils
  to reinstall them.

20190717:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/py-borgmatic
  AUTHOR: egypcio@FreeBSD.org

  The default location for borgmatic's configurations changed. We moved it
  from '/etc/borgmatic' to '/usr/local/etc/borgmatic' in order to follow
  recommended standards used on FreeBSD.

20190710:
  AFFECTS: users with DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6 or c6_64 in /etc/make.conf
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  On amd64 adding DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6 to /etc/make.conf made Linux
  infrastructure ports (linux_base-c6 and linux-c6*) install i386 CentOS 6
  packages.  Using c6_64 instead of c6 made them install mixed amd64/i386
  CentOS 6 packages and allowed Linux application ports to install amd64
  binaries when available.  The i386-only configuration was only useful for
  users of x11/nvidia-driver* which didn't provide Linux amd64 emulation
  until recently.

  With x11/nvidia-driver* now supporting Linux amd64 there's no longer a
  need for i386-only Linux on amd64 so DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6 has been
  changed to make Linux infrastructure ports install mixed amd64/i386
  CentOS 6 packages, like c6_64 before, and support for c6_64 has been
  removed.

  Users with DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6 should reinstall linux_base-c6 and
  all packages that depend on it.  A list of dependent packages can be
  obtained with the following command:

    pkg info -r linux_base-c6

  Users with DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6_64 only need to replace c6_64 with
  c6 in /etc/make.conf.

  Users of x11/nvidia-driver* should upgrade to FreeBSD 11.3 or 12.0 if
  they want to run Linux amd64 OpenGL programs.  If you are running an
  older version you may want to postpone installing or updating Linux
  application ports until you find the time to upgrade because application
  ports may install amd64 binaries now.  Infrastructure ports are safe to
  reinstall, and so is x11/nvidia-driver*.

  On i386 nothing has changed.

20190707:
  AFFECTS: users of www/gitlab-ce
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  You must at first upgrade to version 11.11.5 before you can upgrade

20190701:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql56-(server|client)
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The default MySQL version has been updated from 5.6 to 5.7.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 5.6 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep MySQL 5.6 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=mysql=5.6

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  running server instance. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  on installed packages.

  # pkg set -o databases/mysql56-client:databases/mysql57-client
  # pkg set -o databases/mysql56-server:databases/mysql57-server
  # pkg upgrade

  AFFECTS: users of net/samba410
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  If you used Samba in AD/DC mode with the previous versions of the port on UFS2
  backed storage you have to add usage of vfs_freebsd VFS module for at least
  SYSVOL share and configure it to use 'legacy' mode(see manpage).

  The reason behind this is that previous versions Samba port used a hack to
  workaround broken mapping of Linux security and trusted extended attributes
  into FreeBSD namespace. In particular, essential security.NTACL attribute
  was replaced with the user.NTACL and placed in a insecure USER namespace.

  This port dropped this hack in favor of vfs_freebsd module, which should
  provide more controlled way of such a mapping.

  To maintain the compatibility with the previous installations on UFS2 storage
  (as ZFS uses it's own way of mapping SYSVOL, thanks to the iXsystems patches)
  the vfs_freebsd module provides 'legacy' mode that implements old functionality.

  For the fresh installations it is recommended to use 'secure' mode of operations
  for this module and use it as a global vfs objects.

  Caution: The given module is still considered EXPERIMENTAL.

  AFFECTS: users of net/samba410, net/samba4[6-8] and devel/talloc?, devel/tevent?, databases/tdb?, databases/ldb*
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  The port of the new version of Samba 4.10 is introduced. Due necessarily
  to keep backwards compatibility for the legacy samba4[6-8] ports the
  upgrade procedure is a bit convoluted.

  You are safe to perform fresh new install of samba410 port. In case you
  are upgrading from the previous versions of Samba, please use the
  following procedure:

  0.  Take backups of all the relevant files, in particular PREFIX/etc/smb4.conf
      and /var/db/samba4/ subdirectory. Keep in mind that files there (may)
      have extended attributes, so use appropriate tools to preserve them.

  1a. If you haven't updated Samba between 20190619 and 20190630 then next
      step should be as simple as:

        portmaster -o net/samba410 net/samba48

  1b. If you have been affected by the archiving legacy versions of
      Samba-related libraries for legacy versions of Samba, which happened
      in the given time frame, then you need to reverse operation from the
       20190619 entry:

      for users of portmaster:
        portmaster -o devel/talloc devel/talloc1
        portmaster -o devel/tevent devel/tevent1

  To introduce samba410(we deliberately skip samba49 due the complexity of handling)
  and to drop dependency on deprecated Python 2.7, Samba supplementary libraries
  talloc, tevent and tdb were split into current Python 3 compatible versions
  and legacy ones, with the suffix "1".

  Old versions of Samba were changed to depend on the legacy supplementary libraries,
  so if you need to install samba46, samba47 or samba48 over previous Samba
  installations you need to downgrade supplementary libs with the following commands:

  for users of portmaster:
        portmaster -o devel/talloc1 devel/talloc
        portmaster -o devel/tevent1 devel/tevent
        portmaster -o databases/tdb1 databases/tdb
        portmaster -r talloc1

  for users of portupgrade:
        portupgrade -o devel/talloc1 devel/talloc
        portupgrade -o devel/tevent1 devel/tevent
        portupgrade -o databases/tdb1 databases/tdb
        portupgrade -fr devel/talloc1

  AFFECTS: users of www/qt5-webengine
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Users that upgrade www/qt5-webengine without using pkg/poudriere might
  experience failures due to conflicts with the installed version of 5.12.2.

  In that case, pkg delete -f the qt5-webengine package before building
  the updated version.

  AFFECTS: users of net/routinator
  AUTHOR: rodrigo@FreeBSD.org

  Release 0.4.0 fundamentally changes the command line options for
  running the server and introduces a new way to initialize the local RPKI
  repository used by Routinator.
  If you have been using previous releases, you will likely have to adjust
  your tooling. We apologize for this, but we also feel that the new commands
  are more intuitive and logical.

  AFFECTS: users of net/samba47
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of samba has been switched from 4.7 to 4.8.
  Upgrade instructions:

  For package users having samba47 installed indirectly (as a dependency):
    # pkg upgrade

  For package users having samba47 installed directly (leaf port):
    # pkg upgrade
    # pkg install samba48

  For ports users:
    If you want to keep samba47, add DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= samba=4.7 to make.conf

    If you want to upgrade to samba48, remove samba47:
    # pkg delete -f samba47

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster net/samba48
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall net/samba48
    # portupgrade -a
