This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

  AUTHOR: ports.maintainer@evilphi.com

  The 3.2->3.3 upgrade requires generating a new setup password hash.
  The normal post-upgrade visit to setup.php will walk you through the
  steps.

  For more information, see the "Version 3.3" section of the change log:
  https://github.com/postfixadmin/postfixadmin/blob/postfixadmin-3.3.9/CHANGELOG.TXT

  You need to run
    sed -i -e 's:^karaf.framework.equinox=.*:karaf.framework.equinox=mvn\:org.eclipse.platform/org.eclipse.osgi/3.16.200: ; s:^karaf.framework.felix=.*:karaf.framework.felix=mvn\:org.apache.felix/org.apache.felix.framework/6.0.4:' /var/db/openhab/userdata/etc/config.properties

  The upgrade of Gitlab 14.0.0 is in preparation.
  You must upgrade first to 13.12.
  For more information see here:
  https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/06/04/gitlab-moving-to-14-breaking-changes/

  To do the upgrade, make sure you follow the upgrade manuals:
  https://gitlab.fechner.net/mfechner/Gitlab-docu/-/tree/master/update

  I will merge the 14.0.0 upgrade later to quarterly branch to give you
  some time for the upgrade to 13.12.

20210620:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/openhab2
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The openhab v3 port has been committed. Upstream has removed the
  version from the name, as such the FreeBSD port follows in all places
  (start script name, directory names, ...).
  Users are encuraged to migrate from misc/openhab2 to misc/openhab.

  No automatic config migration is available Both versions can be
  installed in parallel, but an users has to take care to not run
  both at the same time on the same port.

20210617:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/mesa-libs and x11/nvidia-driver
  AUTHOR: kbowling@FreeBSD.org

  Some libraries from mesa-libs are now provided by libglvnd while
  others were renamed. nvidia-driver already used libglvnd but bundled
  a copy which is now provided as a separate package. When building
  outside poudriere make sure to remove mesa-libs and nvidia-driver
  first in order to avoid conflict with libglvnd.

  For portmaster users:
  # pkg delete -f mesa-libs nvidia-driver
  # portmaster -a

  For portupgrade users:
  # pkg delete -f mesa-libs nvidia-driver
  # portupgrade -a

  AFFECTS: users of www/tt-rss
  AUTHOR: dereks@lifeofadishwasher.com

  tt-rss config.php syntax has changed.  You can find detailed changes
  here https://tt-rss.org/wiki/GlobalConfig or look at config.php.sample.
  Expect your config.php to not work with newer www/tt-rss releases.

  Due to changes in ttrssd before updating you should stop ttrssd or
  otherwise kill the php process running update_daemon2.php.

  AFFECTS: users of security/bitwarden_rs
  AUTHOR: mr@FreeBSD.org

  bitwarden_rs has been renamed to vaultwarden upstream.
  So switch to security/vaultwarden instead.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql??-server
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The rc.conf parameter for the login class of the postgresql daemon has
  changed name from postgresql_class to postgresql_login_class.
  rc.subr(8) states that the parameter should be named ${name}_login_class.
