This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

  AFFECTS: users of security/gnutls
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  GnuTLS now looks for its configuration files in PREFIX/etc (/usr/local/etc)
  instead of /etc.  If the following files exist they have to be moved.  On a
  default installation these files do not exist.

  /etc/gnutls/default-priorities
  /etc/gnutls/pkcs11.conf
  /etc/tpasswd
  /etc/tpasswd.conf

  AFFECTS: users of net-im/ejabberd
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  If you've mod_mam enabled with compress_xml set to true, then you're affected
  by bug where the XML namespace, and tag elements get interchanged in the MAM cache
  which results in invalid XML, and causing XMPP clients to disconnect. For more details,
  please refer to: https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/issues/2744

  This upgrade contains the patch that fixes the problem going forward. For fixing already
  affected users, you'll need to wipe off the MAM cache for the affected users:

      sudo -u ejabberd -H ejabberdctl remove_mam_for_user <user> <server>

20190207:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/mk-livestatus
  AUTHOR: egypcio@FreeBSD.org

  The default Nagios version supported by net-mgmt/mk-livestatus changed
  from Nagios 3 to Nagios 4 - the respective Nagios package was added to
  net-mgmt/mk-livestatus' runtime dependencies.

  If you still need support for Nagios 3 you just need to change the
  options for net-mgmt/mk-livestatus and compile the port yourself.

20190202:
  AFFECTS: users of archivers/urbackup-server
  AUTHOR: freebsd@coombscloud.com

  Some of the port's sources previously included absolute references to /etc/urbackup.  
  The upgrade now changes these references to ${PREFIX}/etc/urbackup. If you have placed 
  any configuration files within /etc/urbackup, these should be relocated to 
  ${PREFIX}/etc/urbackup.

20190124:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/rubygem-fluentd, sysutils/fluent-bit
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The fluentd port has been upgraded from the 0.12 line to 1.3.3.  The upgrade
  is mostly non-disruptive since there is a backward compatibility with 0.12
  plugins and configuration files, but care should be taken about the order of
  server upgrades since fluentd 1.x is unable to send it's data to version 0.12
  instances.  You should carefully read
  https://docs.fluentd.org/v1.0/articles/update-from-v0.12 before performing
  any upgrade activities.

20190120:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/fetchmail
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The fetchmail port no longer offers the X11 option and no longer
  depends on Python.  The corresponding fetchmailconf Python program has now
  been split out into a separate port or package, so that fetchmail itself
  will no longer require Python.

  Users who wish to use fetchmailconf should install the new fetchmailconf
  port or package.

20190119:
  AFFECTS: users of german/webalizer2, japanese/webalizer, polish/webalizer2, portuguese/webalizer-pt_BR, portuguese/webalizer-pt_PT, ukrainian/webalizer, www/geolizer, www/webalizer
  AUTHOR: dinoex@FreeBSD.org

  The option GEOIP has beeen changed to used the new datebase.
  Either copy GeoLite2-Country.mmdb in the working directory,
  or set the GeoIPDatabase option to the location of the file.

20190114:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/qgis
  AUTHOR: rhurlin@gwdg.de

  GIS 3.4 LTR, the first long-term release (LTR) of QGIS 3, has landed
  in the FreeBSD ports tree. It will also replace the previous 2.18 LTR
  in the QGIS package repositories in February 2019 [1].

  Beside, the latest QT4 version 4.8.7 has been EOL since December 2015
  and its expiration date on FreeBSD is set to March, 15th 2019.
  Because QGIS 2 is based on QT4 and Python2, it was decided to not create
  a legacy port for QGIS 2, after graphics/qgis changed to QGIS 3.

  For users moving over from the 2.18 LTR there is a huge list of new
  features and impactful changes in this new 3.4 LTR version. Most notably
  3.x plugins are incompatible with 2.x plugins, so please review your
  plugin usage carefully. Before moving over, if you have not already
  done so, take a look at the changelogs from versions 3.0, 3.2, and
  3.4 [2][3][4] to understand the full scope of changes in the 3.x release.

20190114:
  AFFECTS: x11-wm/sway
  AUTHOR: jbeich@FreeBSD.org

  swayidle and swaylock split out into x11/swayidle and x11/swaylock.
  Check your sway config and install those if required.

20190113:
  AFFECTS: users of net/GeoIP
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  Maxmind no longer provides geolocation data in the legacy format used
  by net/GeoIP. All GEOIP-related OPTIONS have been removed, and all
  GeoIP-dependent ports will be removed soon.

  Where possible, you must switch to net/libmaxminddb, which uses the
  newer (and fully supported) GeoIP 2 format. Unfortunately, this is
  not a drop-in replacement. To fetch the GeoIP 2 geolocation databases,
  whether the free or paid versions, you must use net/geoipupdate
  (pkg install geoipupdate).

  The legacy database is no longer available, and we cannot distribute
  it by the Maxmind license, so the legacy GeoIP format is essentially
  dead.

20190108:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql-connector-java
  AUTHOR: matthew@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/mysql-connector-java port has been updated to 8.0.13,
  which requires a minimum of Java 1.8, so dropping support for Java
  1.6 and 1.7.  Users of those versions of Java should substitute the
  databases/mysql-connector-java51 port which remains at version
  5.1.47

20190103:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/vlc*
  AUTHOR: riggs@FreeBSD.org

  The multimedia/vlc port has been upgraded to 3.0.5, the latest upstream
  release. Subsequently, multimedia/vlc-qt4 and multimedia/vlc3 have been
  retired and removed from the ports tree. Users who previously used
  multimedia/vlc3 might want to switch to multimedia/vlc with the following
  commands:

  # pkg install multimedia/vlc
    or
  # portmaster -o multimedia/vlc multimedia/vlc3
    or
  # portupgrade -o multimedia/vlc multimedia/vlc3

20190102:
  AFFECTS: users of net/serviio
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  If you have customized your etc/serviio/profile.xml you need to review
  and merge changes from the profile.xml.sample file, else you may not be
  able to watch mkv files.

20181228:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/trio
  AUTHOR: rodrigo@freebsd.org

  Since trio 1.16-1, the shared lib previously misnamed libtrio.so.2.0.0
  is now named libtrio.so.2 and the symlink libtrio.so is created.

20181222:
  AFFECTS: users of net/ntopng
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Since ntopng 3.7, for security reasons, the default setting for
  the data directory has been changed to "/var/db/ntopng", and the
  default user has been changed to "ntopng". This new directory is
  created automatically by the port/package with correct permissions.

  In order to maintain backward compatibility, if you are already
  using "/var/tmp/ntopng" as data directory, ntopng keeps using that
  folder, owned by "nobody". This said, using the old defaults is not
  recommended and a manual action is required in order to migrate to
  the new settings, unless you are already using a custom directory:

  # service ntopng stop
  # mv /var/tmp/ntopng/* /var/db/ntopng/
  # chown -R ntopng:ntopng /var/db/ntopng
  # service ntopng start

  Please check hte upstream FAQ for reference:

  AFFECTS: users of misc/openhab2
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  If you upgrade from a previous version, make a backup of
       /var/db/openhab2
  and run
       %%PREFIX%%/libexec/openhab2/runtime/bin/update.freebsd

  Config specific info (changes from 2.3.0 to 2.4.0):
  Astro Binding: The 'kilometer' and 'miles' channels have been replaced
                 by a new 'distance' channel
  Jeelink Binding: The 'currentWatt' and 'maxWatt' channels have been
                   replaced with 'currentPower' and 'maxPower' channels
  WeatherUnderground Binding: A bridge has been added on top of the
                              current things, you need to add a bridge
                              containing your api-key.
  ZWave Binding: Major changes have been merged to support features
                 such as security. All things must be deleted and
                 re-added. Refer to
                 https://community.openhab.org/t/zwave-binding-updates/51080
                 for further information.
  Synop Binding is now using UoM. 'wind-speed-ms' and 'wind-speed-knots'
                channels have been replaced by a single 'wind-speed'
                channel.
  Amazonechocontrol Binding: The account thing does not have settings
                             anymore. You have to login at amazon
                             once again through the proxy server
                             http(s)://<YourOpenHAB>/amazonechocontrol
  Milight Binding: The various available bulb types do not appear in
                   the Paper UI Inbox anymore. The correct bulb need
                   to be added manually. The bulb "zone" is now a
                   configuration. Bulb Things need to be recreated
                   to apply this change.
  Hue emulation: The item to hue ID mapping is no longer stored in
                 files, but in the openHAB storage service. You need
                 to rediscover "devices" in all services that use the
                 hue emulation (Amazon Echo, Google Home, etc).

20181215:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/graylog
  AUTHOR: dch@FreeBSD.org

  The dependent ports for ElasticSearch and MongoDB have both changed,
  and upstream changes to the configuration file may require minor
  changes to work correctly. Refer to the new sample files installed
  alongside the port for reference:

  server.conf
  log4j.xml
  graylog_logging.xml

20181213:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The default Perl version has been switched to Perl 5.28.  If you are using
  binary packages to upgrade your system, you do not have anything to do, pkg
  upgrade will do the right thing.  For the other people, follow the
  instructions in entry 20161103, it should still be the same.

20181212:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/ejabberd
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  There are some new features added in ejabberd 18.12, esp. related to
  bookmarks, and XML compression in message archive storage. Please
  refer to: https://blog.process-one.net/ejabberd-18-12/

20181211:
  AFFECTS: users of news/inn when upgrading to FreeBSD 12
  AUTHOR: naddy@FreeBSD.org

  When upgrading from FreeBSD 11 to 12, a change in the size of the
  ino_t type causes a binary incompatibility in the overview database
  if the default tradindexed format is used.

  After upgrading the inn package, remove the overview/group.index
  file and regenerate the history and overview database with
  makehistory(8) before starting innd.

  # echo '. /usr/local/news/lib/innshellvars && \
        rm -f $OVERVIEWDIR/group.index && \
        $NEWSBIN/makehistory -O -s `wc -l <$HISTORY`' | \
        su -fm news -c '/bin/sh -s'

20181209:
  AFFECTS: users of DRM ports other than graphics/drm-kmod
  AUTHOR: jmd@FreeBSD.org

  In order to facilitate future porting efforts and help in supporting multiple
  FreeBSD versions, the DRM ports other than drm-kmod (graphics/drm-stable-kmod,
  graphics/drm-next-kmod, graphics/drm-devel-kmod) have been renamed to
  include the FreeBSD version they are designed for.

  drm-stable-kmod is drm-fbsd11.2-kmod
  drm-next-kmod is drm-fbsd12.0-kmod
  drm-devel-kmod is drm-current-kmod

20181209
  AFFECTS: users of devel/geany and devel/geany-plugins
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Geany and its plugins port have been moved to gtk3 and a new gtk2
  flavor has been added. The gtk2 flavor has a -gtk2 suffix added to the
  package name.

  If you want to stay with the gtk2 version you need to use "pkg install"
  to install the new gtk2 flavor, pkg will automatically deinstall the
  gtk3 flavors.

  If using port, to maintain the gtk2 version, you will need to deinstall
  geany and its plugins and reinstall specifying the gtk2 flavor.

  Note that the following plugins are not available if using the new
  gtk3 flavor:

  * geany-plugin-debugger
  * geany-plugin-devhelp
  * geany-plugin-geanypy
  * geany-plugin-multiterm
  * geany-plugin-scope

20181208:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/openhab2
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  If you upgrade from a previous version, make a backup of
       /var/db/openhab2
  and run
       %%PREFIX%%/libexec/openhab2/runtime/bin/update.freebsd

  Config specific info (changes from 2.2.0 to 2.3.0):
  Nest Binding: The 'camera' Thing Type now has channel groups.
                Add 'camera#' before the channel ID in the channel UID of
                existing camera channels. The 'time_to_target_mins' channel
                of the 'thermostat' Thing Type is renamed to 'time_to_target'
  Oceanic Binding: The 'softener' Thing Type no longer exists and is replaced
                   by the 'serial' and 'ethernet' Thing Types
  Yamaha Receiver Binding: The configuration parameter names now use lower
                           camel case convention. Change 'HOST' to 'host',
                           'PORT' to 'port' etc

20181124:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/munin-master, sysutils/munin-node, www/owncloud, mail/mailman, net/ntpa
  AUTHOR: woodsb02@FreeBSD.org

  The newsyslog.conf(5) filename installed by the port has been changed:
  OLD: ${PREFIX}/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/${PORTNAME}
  NEW: ${PREFIX}/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/${PORTNAME}.conf

  Any file found at the old location will be automatically moved to the new
  location. This will ensure log rotation will continue to work after change
  r340318 to FreeBSD base, where the default newsyslog configuration now only
  includes filenames that end with '.conf' and do not begin with '.'.

  If you use provisioning/configuration management tools to create or edit this
  file, you will need to change their configuration to use the new filename.

20181111
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/mesa-libs
  AUTHOR: jbeich@FreeBSD.org

  Wayland support has been enabled in ports where it doesn't exclude
  X11 support in order to make the binary packages usable with Wayland
  compositors. If you get strange build failures re-run "make config"
  to pick up the new defaults. If the extra dependencies are not
  desired add the following to make.conf:

    OPTIONS_UNSET += WAYLAND

20181109
  AFFECTS: users of security/ossec-hids-server
  AUTHOR: dominik.lisiak@bemsoft.pl

  The "ossechids_enable" rc variable has been renamed to "ossec_hids_enable".

  If using database output, you need to recreate database using new schema
  provided in /usr/local/share/doc/ossec-hids.

20181109
  AFFECTS: users of security/ossec-hids-local
  AUTHOR: dominik.lisiak@bemsoft.pl

  The "ossechids_enable" rc variable has been renamed to "ossec_hids_enable".

  If using database output, you need to recreate database using new schema
  provided in /usr/local/share/doc/ossec-hids.

20181109
  AFFECTS: users of security/ossec-hids-client
  AUTHOR: dominik.lisiak@bemsoft.pl

  The ossec-hids-client port has been renamed to ossec-hids-agent.
  Portmaster users will need to run this command:

  portmaster -o security/ossec-hids-agent security/ossec-hids-client

  If the switch doesn't happen automatically for you, just delete the
  ossec-hids-client package and install ossec-hids-agent.

  The "ossechids_enable" rc variable has been renamed to "ossec_hids_enable".

20181104:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/ansible*
  AUTHOR: lifanov@FreeBSD.org

  Default Ansible configuration location changed to LOCALBASE/etc/ansible
  instead of a per-flavor directory. If you use system-wide Ansible
  configuration, please migrate from a flavored directory to a common
  one:

  # mv /usr/local/etc/py27-ansible /usr/local/etc/ansible

20181031:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The www/node port has been updated to Node.js v11.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. A new port, www/node10, has been created for the
  v10.x LTS branch. Users wanting to stay on v10.x can replace www/node
  with www/node8 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg install www/node10
    or
  # portmaster -o www/node10 www/node
    or
  # portupgrade -o www/node10 www/node

20181022:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php71
  AUTHOR: joneum@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PHP has been switched from 7.1 to 7.2.

  If you use binary packages you should make a list of php packages
  before running 'pkg upgrade':

  # pkg info php7\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  If you use mod_php71 you need to deinstall it and install mod_php72.

20181020:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 2.8 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

20181018:
  AFFECTS: users of security/hitch
  AUTHOR: zi@FreeBSD.org

  Hitch has been updated to run as the hitch user/group, instead of the
  previous default of nobody/nobody.  You should review your hitch
  configuration to ensure that everything has been updated to reflect
  this change.

20181014:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/ansible
  AUTHOR: lifanov@FreeBSD.org

  Ansible has been updated to 2.7.0. Please follow the porting guide
  to update the rulesets:

  https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides/porting_guide_2.7.html

  If you wish to stay with 2.6 version, you can switch
  to new sysutils/ansible2.6 port, which tracks stable 2.6 branch:

  # pkg set -n ansible:ansible26

20181010:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/courier-imap and other courier ports
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Courier-IMAP 5.0.0 added IMAP UTF8 support, and converted maildir
  folders' names to Unicode.

  Updating an existing system to Courier-IMAP 5.0, and later,
  requires a manual one-time conversion of all existing maildirs
  using the maildirmake command. See the maildirmake(1) manual page
  for more information.

  All other courier ports accessing maildirs also need to be updated
  at the same time.

20181009:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/pecl-xdebug*
  AUTHOR: pizzamig@FreeBSD.org

  xdebug 2.6.1 (devel/pecl-xdebug) is the new default version and it supports
  PHP from 7.0 to 7.2 included.
  If you're using PHP 5.6, the previous compatible xdebug version is still
  available in devel/pecl-xdebug25
  If you're using PHP 7.3, the only compatible xdebug version is available
  in devel/pecl-xdebug-devel

20180930:
  AFFECTS: users of DRM components
  AUTHOR: jmd@FreeBSD.org

  A metaport, graphics/drm-kmod, was introduced for users of both the LinuxKPI-
  based DRM components as well as the legacy ones. It is recommended to use the
  metaport from now on, which will select a recommended DRM version based on
  the FreeBSD version.

20180924:
  AFFECTS: www/libresonic-standalone
  AUTHOR: jlh@FreeBSD.org

  HTTPS support has been removed from the port, as it will be removed upstream:
    https://github.com/Libresonic/libresonic/issues/125#issuecomment-256227104

  In order to avoid strange behavior for users who are using this feature, the
  rc.d script will fail fast if libresonic_ssl="YES". You should remove the
  following variables from rc.conf(5): libresonic_ssl libresonic_ssl_keystore
  libresonic_ssl_password.

  # sed -i '' /libresonic_ssl/d /etc/rc.conf

  Users needing SSL are encouraged to use an HTTP reverse-proxy. Example
  configurations can be found here:
    https://github.com/Libresonic/libresonic/issues/119

20180922:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/ilmbase, graphics/OpenEXR
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The IlmBase package has been updated to 2.3.0.
  The OpenEXR package has been renamed to openexr and updated to 2.3.0.

  The PORTREVISION of all ports requiring either has been bumped to
  ease the reubuilds, and where there were versions in the file names,
  these have been removed from the *_DEPENDS lines for easier maintenance.

  A full ports or package upgrade should just work.

  If you are doing partial updates, be sure to rebuild and reinstall
  all packages that require either of OpenEXR or ilmbase.
  Normally, these can be listed by running:

  # pkg info -q -r OpenEXR ilmbase  | sort -u | xargs pkg info -q -o

20180905:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php56
  AUTHOR: tz@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PHP has been switched from 5.6 to 7.1.

  If you use binary packages you should make a list of php packages
  before running 'pkg upgrade':

  # pkg info php5\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  If you use mod_php56 you need to deinstall it and install mod_php71.

20180901:
  AFFECTS: net/samba48
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  Samba ports from now on are not dependent from the databases/ldb* ports,
  as the link between Samba and LDB is too tight and each next major Samba
  release requires it's own major LDB release. Please, remove installed
  version of databases/ldb13 from your system with:

  # pkg delete -f databases/ldb13

20180901:
  AFFECTS: net-mgmt/librenms
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  As of version 1.42, to conform with man hier, logs and rrd files have
  relocated outside the WWW directory. When upgrading from < 1.42 to more
  recent versions, the following steps are required.

  You must update config.php and manually relocate the rrd and log files.
  Before upgrading, please stop librenms,  update the configuration, and
  relocate the files.

  If you find graphs are not updating, fping >= 4.0 requires an IPv6
  address. Adding an IPv6 address should fix graphing.

  Please add these entries to config.php:

  $config['installed_from_package'] = true;
  $config['log_dir'] = '/var/log/librenms';
  $config['rrd_dir'] = '/var/db/librenms/rrd';

  To relocate the files:

  mkdir /var/log/librenms /var/db/librenms
  chown www:ww: /var/log/librenms /var/db/librenms
  cd /usr/local/www/librenms
  mv rrd /var/db/librenms/
  mv logs/librenms.log /var/log/librenms/
  rmdir logs

  An application key is required. Please follow these steps to generate it:

  cd /usr/local/www/librenms
  cp -i .env.sample .env

  You might need to set your database details in that file.
  Then run:

  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  There have been some breaking changes to the GeoIP.conf in version 3.0.0.
  Read about the changes at
    https://github.com/maxmind/geoipupdate/blob/master/ChangeLog.md

  AFFECTS: databases/postgresql??-server
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The PostgreSQL server packages are no longer built with support for the XML
  datatype per default. To retain support for the XML datatype you should build
  the port and check the XML option in the option dialog. The reason for this
  is the bad security reputation of libxml2.

20180806:
  AFFECTS: www/tt-rss
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  tt-rss now uses pdo_mysql/pgsql for database acccess; a web server reload
  will be required if pdo ext. isn't installed.

20180804:
  AFFECTS: net-mgmt/zabbix*-server
  AUTHOR: dbaio@FreeBSD.org

  The JAVAGW option was removed from the Zabbix Server and an additional slave
  port was created, zabbix*-java, it installs only Zabbix Java Gateway files,
  this way is possible to deploy a Zabbix Java Gateway without the need to
  install Zabbix Server components.

  If you are using the JAVAGW option on Zabbix Server, please, install now the
  new zabbix*-java port.

20180803
  AFFECTS: users of net/openntpd
  AUTHOR: naddy@FreeBSD.org

  The numerical ID of the "_ntp" user had to be moved after 12.0-CURRENT
  (revision 336525) took over its value for a user "ntpd" that uses a
  different privilege model.

  To avoid clashes between the two users, please remove the openntpd
  package, delete the old UID with

  # pw userdel _ntp

  and re-install openntpd.

20180731:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/sndio
  AUTHOR: tobik@FreeBSD.org

  sndiod(8) will now use the default audio device /dev/dsp instead
  of /dev/dsp0 if no device was specified.

  The location of ~/.aucat_cookie has moved to ~/.sndio/cookie.  If
  you share audio devices via sndiod(8) on the network or between
  local users, please migrate it manually to the new location to
  guarantee a smooth upgrade.

20180731:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg and all ports with USE_XORG=*proto
  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  The xorg *proto packages have all been merged into one package,
  x11/xorgproto.  This might cause issues with upgrading.  If you
  get conflicts between xorgproto and old *proto packages, please
  remove the old package and install xorgproto again.

  In order to remove all orphaned ports, including all *proto port,
  the following can be used after the ports tree has been updated:
  pkg version -l \? | cut -f 1 -w | grep -v compat | xargs pkg delete -fy

20180728:
  AFFECTS: users who upgrade from security/kc to security/kc24
  AUTHOR: pi@FreeBSD.org

  The ondisk format changes from kc 2.3 to kc 2.4, so please
  read the kc24 pkg-message file before the upgrade. It describes
  how to create a backup, the xml dump and how to import the
  xml dump afterwards.

20180725:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/ibus-typing-booster
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  Due to a migration from IBusConfig to GSettings, the old settings are
  unfortunately lost, so one has to open the setup tool and recreate ones
  favourite settings.

20180714:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/dnsdist
  AUTHOR: cpm@FreeBSD.org

  After discussing with several users, we noticed that quite a lot of them
  were not aware that enabling the dnsdist's console without a key, even
  restricted to the local host, could be a security issue and allow privilege
  escalation by allowing an unprivileged user to connect to the console and
  execute Lua code as the dnsdist user. We therefore decided to refuse any
  connection to the console until a key has been set, so please check that
  you do set a key before upgrading if you use the console.

  For further details read:
  https://blog.powerdns.com/2018/07/10/dnsdist-1-3-2-released/

20180704:
  AFFECTS: users of www/gitlab
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  The gitlab port uses the package from gitlab.org instead of github.org.
  For this the port was renamed from gitlab to gitlab-ce.
  Please follow the instructions very carefully to not lose your data!
  Not only the package was renamed, also the directory name changed.

  You can find the current instruction here:
  https://gitlab.fechner.net/mfechner/Gitlab-docu/blob/master/update/10.8-11.0-freebsd.md

  Please note the update was only tested for an update from 10.8.5 to 11.0.2.
  If your version of gitlab was released before 2014-03-13 you cannot update
  to this version. You need to make an intermediate update to an earlier
  version before.

20180701:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/bats
  AUTHOR: lifanov@FreeBSD.org

  The devel/bats port has been renamed to devel/bats-core to match the
  new upstream project.

20180630:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/ejabberd
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  In version 18.06, upstream has removed support for IRC transport.

20180625:
  AFFECTS: users of PHP based applications like drush
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  Flavors are being added to PHP applications. If you use PHP 5.6 you need:

  # pkg set -n drush:drush-php56

  For more details see 20180611.

20180612:
  AFFECTS: users of the nox flavor of editors/emacs-devel
  AUTHOR: jrm@FreeBSD.org

  The package name for the nox flavor of editors/emacs-devel changed from
  emacs-devel_nox to emacs-devel-nox.  To install the new package, run

  # pkg install emacs-devel-nox

  pkg should remove the old and install the new package.

20180612:
  AFFECTS: users of packages that depend on Emacs
  AUTHOR: jrm@FreeBSD.org

  With the release of Emacs version 26.1, the major version of editors/emacs
  changed from 25 to 26, so the names of packages that depend on Emacs have also
  changed.  For example, pdf-tools-emacs25-0.80.79_1 is now called
  pdf-tools-emacs26-0.80.79_1.  The name change means simply running `pkg
  upgrade` will not upgrade foo-emacs25-x to foo-emacs26-x.

  To list the packages to upgrade, use

  # pkg info \*emacs25\*

  then install the new version for each with

  # pkg install foo-emacs26

  pkg should remove the old and install the new packages.

20180611:
  AFFECTS: users of PHP based applications
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Flavors are being added to PHP applications.  When a port is flavorized, pkg
  needs to be told about the name change, for example, if PHP 5.6 is the one
  you need:

  # pkg set -n squirrelmail:squirrelmail-php56

  Most port will have packages for all PHP versions present in the ports tree,
  but some may not be compatible with a specific version.

  To get the available flavors, pkg rquery can be used:

  # pkg rquery %n mail/squirrelmail
  squirrelmail-php56
  squirrelmail-php70
  squirrelmail-php71
  squirrelmail-php72

20180602:
  AFFECTS: users of net/frr
  AUTHOR: olivier@FreeBSD.org

  Due to regression detected in FRR version 4.0, port was renamed to frr4
  to prepare re-introduction of frr3 port version.

  To rename the installed package to match the new naming scheme, run:
  # pkg set -n frr:frr4

20180529:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/ibus-typing-booster
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  Attention, this release merges all engines into one. Therefore, the
  engine names had to change. The old engine names like "German - DE
  (Typing Booster)", "Hindi - HI (Typing Booster)" don't exist anymore!
  If one has entries for them in the Gnome Control Center or in
  ibus-setup, one needs to remove these old entries and add the new
  engine name "Other (Typing Booster)".

20180518:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/ansible*
  AUTHOR: lifanov@FreeBSD.org

  Ansible ports are now flavored. Package names for Ansible changed
  to include python version. Poudriere and package users don't need
  to do anything.

  To rename an installed package to match the new naming scheme,
  for example, for ansible24, run:

   # pkg set -n ansible24:py27-ansible24

20180514:
  AFFECTS: users of www/gitlab
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  Gitlab-pages support was removed as new version does not compile.
  If you require gitlab-pages do not update to version 10.7.3 till it is
  fixed upstream.
  You can find the bug report here:
  https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-pages/issues/143

20180513:
  AFFECTS: users of net/xrdp
  AUTHOR: meta@FreeBSD.org

  net/xrdp has been updated from 0.6.2 to 0.9.6. There are significant
  changes between these versions. You should consider backing up your
  configuration files such as xrdp.ini and sesman.ini, and then migrate
  configuration files by hand.

  Regarding km-*.ini, don't use the old files. They can be safely replaced
  with new ones.

20180507:
  AFFECTS: users of math/suitesparse who build it locally
  AUTHOR: yuri@FreeBSD.org

  The suitesparse needs to be uninstalled before math/suitesparse can be
  correctly built. This is true for the version 5.2.0 and prior versions.

20180505:
  AFFECTS: users of www/gitea
  AUTHOR: stb@lassitu.de

  The www/gitea port no longer requires shell/bash.  If you want to
  stop using bash and deinstall the package, make sure to set the
  configuration in etc/gitea/conf/app.ini, section [repository],
  SCRIPT_TYPE to "sh".  See app.ini.sample for an example.

20180501:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The www/node port has been udpated to Node.js v10.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. This is a major release, including many significant
  changes. Users are encouraged to read the release announcements before
  upgrading:

  https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v10.0.0/

  In particular, Node.js now depends on OpenSSL 1.1.0h, so the
  BUNDLED_SSL option is enabled by default. Users can disable this
  option when using security/openssl-devel as their default SSL library.

20180430:
  AFFECTS: users of news/nntp
  AUTHOR: dinoex@FreeBSD.org

  The option INETD was removed. If you used inetd, please change the path
  in /etc/inetd.conf from /usr/local/sbin/nntpd to /usr/local/libexec/nntpd.

20180428:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 2.7 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

20180427:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/zrepl
  AUTHOR: woodsb02@FreeBSD.org

  The zrepl update to 0.0.3 includes the following breaking changes:
  - Snapshots are automatically bookmarked and pruning of bookmarks must
    be configured by adding the keep_bookmarks parameter to the prune
    policy section of the zrepl configuration file (source side only).
    Be sure to understand the meaning bookmarks have for maximum
    allowable replication downtime.
  - The ssh+stdinserver transport protocol has changed, requiring zrepl
    to be updates on both the sending and receiving side, and the daemon
    restarted on both sides.
  - The first outlet in the global.logging section of the configuration
    file is now used for logging meta-errors (e.g. problems encountered
    when writing to other logging outlets).

20180425:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/pecl-redis
  AUTHOR: daniel@blodan.se

  pecl-redis 4.0.0 breaks backwards compatibility, users
  not aware if you are using the changed functionality or not
  should swap to databases/pecl-redis3

20180417:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/dnscrypt-proxy2
  AUTHOR: egypcio@googlemail.com

  DNSCrypt-Proxy 2 has been updated to 2.0.10 and the configuration file
  has changed from ${PREFIX}/etc/dnscrypt-proxy.toml to
  ${PREFIX}/etc/dnscrypt-proxy/dnscrypt-proxy.toml.

20180416:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postgrey
  AUTHOR: ports.maintainer@evilphi.com

  If you use any of the optional make.conf variables to specify the
  postgrey user, group, db dir, or run dir when building the port, you will
  need to change the prefix from PG_ to POSTGREY_*.  The variables were
  renamed to solve a namespace collision with the PostgreSQL ports.

20180412:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/php-composer
  AUTHOT: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Flavors have been added to the composer port with the update to
  1.6.3. Due to the change in PKGNAME pkg(and other tools) will not
  notice the update. It is required to tell pkg about the name
  change, for example:

  # pkg set -n php-composer:php56-composer

20180410:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE SC4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  Most of KDE Applications 17.12.3 have now landed in the ports tree.
  There are still some missing pieces, that will follow soon.

  As mentioned in the commit messages, users of KDE SC4 should stick with the
  <foo>-kde4 named package.

  As the MOVED entries for ports like databases/akonadi-kde4 have been removed
  in the process of updating (as there now is again a databases/akonad), there
  might be issues for people that update from a too old installed package list
  with portmaster.

  These should be fixable by issuing a command à la
  # pkg set --change-origin databases/akonadi:databases/akonadi-kde4 akonadi

20180409:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/matterircd
  AUTHOR: norrland@nullbyte.se

  Matterircd has been updated to 0.17.0 and mattermost configuration settings
  need to be migrated to [mattermost] section. See matterircd.toml.sample.

20180404:
  AFFECTS: users of www/nextcloud
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  With the 13.0.1 update the path for Apps bundled with the package has
  changed from "apps" to "apps-pkg". You must add an entry to the
  "apps_paths" array in config/config.php of your nextcloud installation,
  a patch for the default installation can be applied with:

  # cd /usr/local/www/nextcloud
  # su -m www -c "php ./occ config:import < /usr/local/share/nextcloud/fix-apps_paths.json"
