This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

  AFFECTS: users of samba4[6-8] and devel/talloc, devel/tevent, databases/tdb, databases/ldb*
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  To introduce samba410(we deliberatly skip samba49 due the complexity of handling)
  and to drop dependency on deprecated Python 2.7, Samba supplimentary libraries
  talloc, tevent and tdb were splitted into current Python 3 compatiable versions
  and legacy ones, with the suffix "1".

  Old versions of Samba were changed to depend on the legacy supplimentary libraries,
  so if you need to install samba46, samba47 or samba48 over previous Samba
  installations you need to downgrade supplimentary libs with the following commands:

  for users of portmaster:
        portmaster -o devel/talloc1 devel/talloc
        portmaster -o devel/tevent1 devel/tevent
        portmaster -o databases/tdb1 databases/tdb
        portmaster -r devel/talloc1

  for users of portupgrade:
        portupgrade -o devel/talloc1 devel/talloc
        portupgrade -o devel/tevent1 devel/tevent
        portupgrade -o databases/tdb1 databases/tdb
        portupgrade -fr devel/talloc1

  AFFECTS: users of www/qt5-webengine
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Users that upgrade www/qt5-webengine without using pkg/poudriere might
  experience failures due to conflicts with the installed version of 5.12.2.

  In that case, pkg delete -f the qt5-webengine package before building
  the updated version.

  AFFECTS: users of net/routinator
  AUTHOR: rodrigo@FreeBSD.org

  Release 0.4.0 fundamentally changes the command line options for
  running the server and introduces a new way to initialize the local RPKI
  repository used by Routinator.
  If you have been using previous releases, you will likely have to adjust
  your tooling. We apologize for this, but we also feel that the new commands
  are more intuitive and logical.

  AFFECTS: users of samba47
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of samba has been switched from 4.7 to 4.8.
  Upgrade instructions:

  For package users having samba47 installed indirectly (as a dependency):
    # pkg upgrade

  For package users having samba47 installed directly (leaf port):
    # pkg upgrade
    # pkg install samba48

  For ports users:
    If you want to keep samba47, add DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= samba=4.7 to make.conf

    If you want to upgrade to samba48, remove samba47:
    # pkg delete -f samba47

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster net/samba48
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall net/samba48
    # portupgrade -a
