This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

20140714:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db6
  AUTHOR:  mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Oracle Berkeley DB 6 has been upgraded to version 6.1.19.  Since the
  previous 6.0 version, the log file format has changed in 6.1.
  Depending on applications used, you may need to take action BEFORE you
  upgrade.  For details, please see the online upgrade manual at
  <http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_04/html/upgrading/upgrade_process.html>
  <http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_04/html/installation/upgrade_61_toc.html>

  Note: if you've got Apache installed and depending on db6, you may
  need to upgrade it separately BEFORE upgrading other ports.

  Note: some GNOME-related ports, for instance, evolution-data-server,
  cannot be built if their older version is installed because they run
  their own executables at build-time and prefer libraries from
  $LOCALPATH over freshly-built ones.  For these ports, deinstall
  them with pkg_delete -f or pkg delete -f before trying to upgrade them.

  After that, you must rebuild all applications that link to db6 because
  the shared library name has changed with the upgrade.  To do that:

  If you use portmaster:
        portmaster -w -r db6-
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fr databases/db6

20140714:
  AFFECTS: users of net/linphone-base
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  Linphone has been updated to version 3.7.0 and the linphone-base port
  has been split into separate components.  You must first delete the
  linphone-base package before you can update ports that depend on it.

  pkg del -f linphone-base
    or
  pkg_delete -f linphone-base\*

20140713:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-current
  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  This is a significant update; so, please carefully review the
  RELEASE_NOTES to identify which incompatible changes impact your
  environment. Of particular note are changes to the Postfix
  build/install procedure.

  Please backup main.cf, master.cf and any other important files
  associated with your Postfix setup before updating.

20140713:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache22
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  The default version was changed from www/apache22 to www/apache24,
  pre-build apache modules and web applications will also reflect this!

  In case ports are build by yourself and apache22 is required
  use the following command to keep apache22 as default.

  # echo "DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=apache=2.2" >> /etc/make.conf

20140710:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/rust
  AUTHOR: robak@FreeBSD.org

  The lang/rust port was updated to 0.11 and is now only working on FreeBSD
  versions 10 and 11 - the 9.x support has been removed by upstream.

20140709:
  AFFECTS: users of security/pam-pgsql
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  The pam_pgsql.so module is now installed in PREFIX/lib (/usr/local/lib)
  instead of /usr/lib.

20140627:
  AFFECTS: Users of Java
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of OpenJDK has been updated from 1.6 to 1.7. To update,
  users of Java will need to rebuild all ports that depend on Java:

  If you use pkg (regardless of if you build ports from source or install
  binary packages):
  # pkg set -o java/openjdk6:java/openjdk7

  If you use portmaster to build ports from source:

  # portmaster -o java/openjdk7 openjdk6
  # portmaster -R -r openjdk

  If you use portupgrade to build ports from source:

  # portupgrade -fo java/openjdk7 java/openjdk6

  If you use pkg to install prebuilt binary packages:

  # pkg install -fR java/openjdk7

  If you wish to keep the 1.6 version as default, add the following lines to
  your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep OpenJDK 1.6 as default version.
  #
  JAVA_PREFERRED_PORTS=JAVA_PORT_NATIVE_OPENJDK_JDK_1_6

20140627:
  AFFECTS: users of security/amavisd-milter
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  The default working directory of security/amavisd-milter have been
  changed to /var/run/amavis/.  Users will have to adjust path to the
  milter socket.

20140627:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/emacs21 and editors/emacs22
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  editors/emacs21, and editors/emacs22 are removed as they were
  unmaintained upstream for a while. Their dependent ports are removed
  as well. Please switch to editors/emacs (Emacs 24 release), or
  editors/emacs23 (Emacs 23 release), or editors/emacs-devel (Emacs
  development branch) ports.

20140626:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/qmail-spamcontrol
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Spamcontrol has been updated to the 2.7 release.

  It is advised to read the release notes as some features were removed and
  others reworked.

  http://www.fehcom.de/qmail/spamcontrol/RELEASE_27.spamcontrol

  2.7 manual: http://www.fehcom.de/qmail/spamcontrol/README_spamcontrol.html

20140626:
  AFFECTS: users of comms/smstools3
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The smstools3 startup screen has been modified to allow smsd to
  change uid/gid by itself. The rc options smsd_logfile, smsd_user
  and smsd_group are not supported anymore, user, group and log
  filename should be specified in the configuration file.

  The sample configuration file has been updated to have defaults
  equivalent to the old ones.

20140624:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/p5-Bucardo
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The bucardo_ctl script has been renamed to bucardo, so, to follow the naming,
  the bucardo_ctl_enable rc variable has been renamed to bucardo_enable.

20140622:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gpgme
  AUTHOR: jhale@FreeBSD.org

  If you have both security/gnupg AND security/gnupg1 installed, gpgme will
  now automatically detect and use security/gnupg.  Specifically, it will
  search for gpgconf(1) first and use the paths for the binaries provided
  by it.  Failing that, it will search for a binary named "gpg".

  It is no longer possible to specify the location of the gpg binary at
  buildtime to differentiate between version 1.x and version 2.x.  The port
  options GNUPG1 and GNUPG2 now merely add their respective versions of gnupg
  as build and runtime dependencies.

20140618:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/m17n-* textproc/*m17n*
  AUTHOR: Nikola Lecic <nikola.lecic@anthesphoria.net>

  devel/m17n-db now incorporates a set of user-contributed input methods and
  a conversion script, formerly available through textproc/m17n-contrib.
  Delete textproc/m17n-contrib first and then update/install devel/m17n-db.

20140616:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion
  AUTHOR: lev@FreeBSD.org

  The subversion port has been overhauled. Some optional parts were extracted
  into separate ports. These ports are:

  www/mod_dav_svn
    instead of option MOD_DAV_SVN.
  security/subversion-gnome-keyring
    instead of option GNOME_KEYRING.
  security/subversion-kwallet
    instead of option KDE_KWALLET.

  If you used devel/subversion with one (or more) of these non-standard
  options, you should install the appropriate port(s) after upgrading
  subversion.

  "mod_dontdothat" is installed unconditionally by www/mod_dav_svn port (it
  depended on the TOOLS option before), but is not activated by default, you
  may need to edit apache's configuration file.

  The devel/subversion port now installs svndiff, svndiff3 and svndiff4
  commands if TOOLS option is enabled. They was skipped before.
  The official names "diff", "diff3" and "diff4" are prefixed with "svn" to
  avoid conflicts with base and other diff versions.

  All libraries and binaries are now stripped if the MAINTAINER_DEBUG
  option is not selected (including all sub-ports, like bindings
  and mod_dav_svn).

20140611:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/icu
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  icu has been updated to 53.1. Please rebuild all ports that depend on it

  If you use portmaster:
        portmaster -w -r icu
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fr devel/icu
  If you use pkgng with binary packages:
        pkg install -fR devel/icu

20140610:
  AFFECTS: users of www/firefox, www/seamonkey, mail/thunderbird, www/libxul
  AUTHOR: gecko@FreeBSD.org

  Gecko ports were switched to use more system libraries. Some of them
  must be built with certain options unset (default).
  - audio/soundtouch has to be installed with INTEGER_SAMPLES option disabled

20140604:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/dnscrypt-proxy
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  The 1.4.0 update to dns/dnscrypt-proxy introduced a privilege
  separation capability utilizing the new _dnscrypt-proxy user.
  The home directory for this user was misconfigured as /nonexistent.
  The dnscrypt-proxy server will try to chroot to _dnscrypt-proxy's home
  directory and fail to start. If you are affected you will need to
  change _dnscrypt-proxy's home directory to /var/empty:

  # pw usermod _dnscrypt-proxy -d /var/empty

20140603:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/zetacoin
  AUTHOR: daniel@morante.net

  The zetacoind process now runs as the zetacoin user. Please make sure that
  this user has appropriate permissions to the blockchain database and wallet
  directory.

  If you are using the default path, run:

  # chown -R zetacoin:zetacoin /var/db/zetacoin
  # chown -R zetacoin:zetacoin /.zetacoin

20140529:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql??-(server|client)
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  PostgreSQL version 9.2 is now the default. To upgrade from a version
  lower than 9.2, follow the instructions on the PostgreSQL.org website.
  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/interactive/upgrading.html

  When using binary packages, if you only use the client port, you can issue
  the following command to follow the default version:

  # pkg set -o databases/postgresql90-client:databases/postgresql92-client

20140528:
  AFFECTS: users of security/calife & security/calife-devel
  AUTHOR: roberto@FreeBSD.org

  and install security/calife.

  Change origin if you had the old one:
  # pkg set -o security/calife-devel:security/calife

20140527:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db6
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Oracle BerkeleyDB 6.0 was upgraded to version 6.0.30.  Databases that
  use BLOBs need to be upgraded using db_upgrade-6.0 before they can be
  accessed again. See the manual for details:

  <http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_03/html/api_reference/C/db_upgrade.html>

  Databases that do not use BLOBs are unaffected.

20140521:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mariadb55*
  AUTHOR: grembo@FreeBSD.org

  The mariadb55-client and mariadb55-server port have been changed to
  respect hier(7) and behave like the mysql ports. Therefore mysql-server
  and mysql monitor will refuse to start if my.cnf exists in /etc or
  /etc/mysql.

  In case you're affected, please move /etc/my.cnf to /usr/local/etc and/or
  /etc/mysql/my.cnf to /usr/local/etc/mysql.

20140520:
  AFFECTS: users of security/dropbear
  AUTHOR: ak@FreeBSD.org

    or
  # portupgrade -fo lang/gnu-cobol lang/open-cobol
    or
  # pkg set -o lang/open-cobol:lang/gnu-cobol

20140506:
  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/portshaker
  AUTHOR: romain@FreeBSD.org

  ports-mgmt/portshaker was updated to avoid creating an aditional 'ports'
  subdirectory when merging to a poudriere_tree without ZFS, so that
  portshaker's default location matches poudriere's default location.

  Users of poudriere on non-ZFS systems should not anymore have to pass extra
  options to poudriere for it to find the ports tree.

20140506:
  AFFECTS: users of security/yassl
  AUTHOR: gahr@FreeBSD.org

  security/yassl was moved to security/cyassl to match the original package
  name.  Please do the following according to package manager used.

  being able to bootstrap itself.  Please deinstall openjdk7 before
  building the new version.

20140427:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/gdal
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  Due to changes in header files, please deinstall gdal first while updating
  from 1.9.x/1.10.x to 1.11.x.

20140420:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba4
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  Samba4 port now re-uses the same logic and startup script as Samba41. So,
  to get net/samba4 runing you need to rename samba4_enable in /etc/rc.conf
  to the samba_sever_enable.

  samba_server_enable="YES"

  Startup script tries it's best to guess which out of samba/nmbd/smbd/winbindd
  daemons have to be started, but you can fine tune this by specifying them in
  rc.conf, just make sure that samba_server_enable is enabled(see entry for 20121022).

20140416:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg graphics/dri graphics/libGL and related ports
  AUTHOR: x11@FreeBSD.org

  The default xorg version has been switched on FreeBSD 10-STABLE and
  FreeBSD 9-STABLE.

  To upgrade graphics/libGL, graphics/dri and related MESA ports, it is
  necessary to first remove the old versions of those ports.
  No special upgrade procedure is needed for xorg ports but it is
  necessary to recompile all xorg drivers (xf86-*) and other ports that
  depend on the xserver version, including
  emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions.  Portrevisions have been bumped
  where needed, but users of drivers not in the ports tree will need to
  recompile those.

  If it is important to stay on the old versions, it is possible to
  specify WITHOUT_NEW_XORG= in /etc/make.conf to get the old xorg
  distribution.

  For users in need of working console when using KMS drivers (intel and
  radeon graphics cards) please use the new vt(9) console driver.
  For more information, see https://wiki.freebsd.org/Graphics and
  https://wiki.freebsd.org/Newcons .

  To update:

  # pkg_delete -f libGL-\* dri-\*
    or
  # pkg delete -f libGL dri
    followed by
  # portmaster graphics/dri graphics/libGL
    or
  # portupgrade graphics/dri graphics/libGL
    and then
  # portmaster -a
    or
  # portupgrade -a

20140416:
  AFFECTS: users of print/freetype2 textproc/libxml2 x11/pixman
           x11/libxcb and graphics/freeglut
  AUTHOR: x11@FreeBSD.org and gnome@FreeBSD.org

  The library version of the above libraries has been brought in line
  with what upstream expects. To do this all users of these ports need
  to be rebuilt. Portrevisions have been bumped as a consequence.

  # portmaster -r freetype2 -r libxml2 -r pixman -r freeglut -r libxcb
  or
  # portupgrade -rf freetype2 libxml2 pixman freeglut libxcb

20140415:
  AFFECTS: Users of mod_python3
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  www/mod_python3 was renamed to www/mod_python33, additional www/mod_python35
  with support for apache24 was added to the portstree.

  To reflect the new port location use:

  pkgng users:
  # pkg set -o www/mod_python3:www/mod_python33

  portmaster users:
  # portmaster -o www/mod_python33 www/mod_python3

  portupgrade users:
  # portugrade -o www/mod_python33 www/mod_python3

20140414:
  AFFECTS: Users of dmd 1.X and dmd 2.x.
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  lang/dmd and lang/dmd2 have switched places. Dmd 1.x is no longer supported
  by digitalmars.com and is now the secondary dmd port in the collection.
  Dmd2 is the primary port. What this means to dmd users is that dmd1 is now
  used to invoke dmd 1.x and the dmd command (instead of dmd2) now invokes
  dmd 2.x.

20140413:
  AFFECTS: Users of Python and pkg >= 1.2.7_1
  AUTHOR: koobs@FreeBSD.org

  There have been reports of the following error when upgrading Python ports:

    pkg-static: Plist error, directory listed as a file: <name>.egg-info

  The cause is an outdated or unpatched version of setuptools or distribute
  installed by the user, or leftover from previous upgrades being used during
  the `setup.py install` phase. pkg >= 1.2.7_1 now generates an error where
  previously it did not.

  Users should inspect their ${LOCALBASE}/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages
  directory, and remove any entries that reference versions of
  setuptools or distribute *not* provided by ports or packages.

  Examples of entries that may be removed are:

    1) distribute-0.6.35-py2.7.egg
    2) setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg
    3) *Any* version of setuptools directly from PyPi via pip or easy_install

  More information is available here:

  ALTER TABLE `limits` MODIFY `defaultmaxmsgcount` BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

20140403:
  AFFECTS: users of net/rabbitmq
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  This release changes the behaviour of the default "guest" user.

  Previously the guest user could be accessed from any network
  location. In RabbitMQ 3.3.0 and later, the guest user can only
  be accessed via localhost by default.

  Any other users you create will not (by default) be restricted
  in this way.

  See http://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html for more information.

20140403:
  AFFECTS: users of net/kdnssd
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC ports have been updated to 4.12.4. kdnssd package has been renamed
  to match upstream naming. pkgng users need to update package origin
  manually:

  # pkg set -o net/kdnssd:net/zeroconf-ioslave

20140402:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/elasticsearch
  AUTHOR: tj@FreeBSD.org

  Elasticsearch has been updated to version 1.1.0. If you are updating
  from a version prior to 1.0.0 you will need to do a full cluster
  shutdown for this update as it can not be performed in a rolling
  fashion.

20140401:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gnutls3
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Libdane support is no longer enabled by default.  Rebuild the port with
  the LIBDANE option if danetool is desired.

20140331:
  AFFECTS: users of print/cups-client and print/cups-image
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  CUPS ports have been updated to version 1.7.1. A file has migrated from
  cups-image port to cups-client. Before upgrading you should force the
  removal of cups-image port, otherwise it will conflict with the new one.

  pkg users:
  # pkg delete -f cups-image\*

  other users:
  # pkg_delete -f cups-image\*

  2. Install/upgrade other cups* packages.

  If cups-filters complains about a missing cups/raster.h include,
  try reinstalling the cups-client package.

20140327:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php5 and lang/php55 with Apache module
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The Apache PHP module has been separated from the main PHP port.
  If you had the APACHE OPTION selected, you have to perform the
  following steps:

  1) update your lang/php* options (i.e. 'make config')
  2) rebuild lang/php* port
  3) install www/mod_php* port

  It is *mandatory* to build both ports with the same DEBUG and ZTS
  options, so if you have a threaded Apache (i.e. worker or event MPM)
  you have to select the ZTS option in lang/php* port.

20140322:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/apr1
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  APR was updated to 1.5.0, BDB requirement was bumped to 48+
  It is necessary to first remove the old version of devel/apr1.

20140312:
  AFFECTS: users of net/openistgt
  AUTHOR: jpaetzel@FreeBSD.org

  Between istgt supporting target reload, and iscsid using CTL there is no
  point to this port.  As such it has been deleted without warning, since
  the support for it is as best questionable.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/py-setuptools dependent ports
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  devel/py-setuptools is being used for every python ports (if USE_PYDISTUTILS
  defined) since r336553. Due to PKGORIGIN limitation, we cannot build one
  python port with python27 and the other with python33 since they require
  different setuptools versions which have same PKGORIGIN. With the addition
  of py-setuptools{27,32,33}, we could now have py27-foo and py33-bar coexist
  in one system.

  Note that this is only a short-term solution. It does not help if you need
  coexistence of one port with different python versions, e.g. py27-foo and
  py33-foo.

  Please rebuild all ports that depend on devel/py-setuptools and use
  devel/py-setuptools{27,32,33} instead.

  XX represents python version (27, 32 or 33) in the following steps.

  pkgng users:

  # pkg set -o devel/py-setuptools:devel/py-setuptoolsXX

  portmaster users:

  # portmaster -o devel/py-setuptoolsXX devel/py-setuptools
  # portmaster -r py\*setuptools

  AFFECTS: users of misc/kdehier4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE4_PREFIX has been changed from /usr/local/kde4 to /usr/local.
  All ports that depends on kdehier4 must be reinstalled.
  PORTREVISION for affected ports has been increased, upgrading tools
  (portmaster, pkg) should handle this update without manual intervention.
  Please check /usr/local/kde4 for leftovers after upgrade. If you don't
  have locally modified files, e.g. under /usr/local/kde4/etc, you may
  safely remove /usr/local/kde4.

  Perl 5.12 has been removed.  The default Perl is lang/perl5.16.

  pkg(8) users:
    1) Update the origin to point to 5.16:
       pkg set -o lang/perl5.12:lang/perl5.16

    2) Upgrade perl and all dependencies:
       pkg install -Rf lang/perl5.16

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
       pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.16):
       portupgrade -o lang/perl5.16 -f lang/perl5.12

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
       portupgrade -fr lang/perl5.16

  Portmaster users:
    portmaster -o lang/perl5.16 lang/perl5.12

    Conservative:
      portmaster p5-

    Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
      portmaster -r perl-

    Note: If the "perl-" glob matches more than one port specify the name of
      the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.  Also, depending on when
      perl 5.12 was installed last, the prefix may be perl-, perl5- or
      perl5.12-.

20140113:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba41
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  With the introduction of Samba 4.1 corresponding port lost SWAT support
  and made WINBIND support mandatory. As samba4 introduced additional 'samba'
  daemon to the tripplet of nmbd/smbd/winbindd to avoid confusion startup
  script for samba41 was renamed to 'samba_server'. To start the whole band
  up it's enough to add to the rc.conf:

  samba_server_enable="YES"

  Startup script tries it's best to guess which out of samba/nmbd/smbd/winbindd
  daemons have to be started, but you can fine tune this by specifying them in
  rc.conf, just make sure that samba_server_enable is enabled(see entry for 20121022).

20140112:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libical
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  The libical port was updated to 1.0.0. Due to the shared library bump
  and the removal of the .la file, all ports that use libical need to be
  rebuilt.

  # portmaster -r libical

  AUTHOR: jlaffaye@FreeBSD.org

  Third party Go packages installed via the ports tree are no longer installed
  in GOROOT (PREFIX/go) but in a specific path: PREFIX/share/go

  Affected ports had their PORTREVISION bumped.
  To reinstall these packages via the ports tree, it is needed to deinstall
  them first (the build will fail if the `go` command detects that they
  already exists in GOROOT).

  If you are using these third party Go packages for local Go development,
  you have to add this new path to your GOPATH environment variable.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/ruby-bdb or ports-mgmt/portupgrade and databases/db5 or databases/db6
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  databases/db5 and databases/db6 have recently been updated to fix
  bugs. This changed their patchlevel version.

  However, ruby-bdb used to break during the db[56] upgrade due to a bug
  described in <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=184921>.

  THEREFORE, YOU MUST MANUALLY UPGRADE databases/ruby-bdb INDIVIDUALLY
  TO 0.6.6_2 OR NEWER WHEN USING portupgrade AGAINST databases/db[56]
  PORTS. To achieve that, type:

  # portupgrade databases/ruby-bdb
  or
  # portmaster -x 'db*' databases/ruby-bdb

  before proceeding with other upgrades.

  Should you have corrupted the portupgrade databases, or if ruby-bdb
  refuses to work with the upgraded db* port with errors such as "DB
  needs compatible versions of libdb & db.h", then rebuild the ruby-bdb
  port manually, and fix the portupgrade databases:

  # make -C /usr/ports/databases/ruby-bdb all deinstall install clean
  # pkgdb -fu
  # portupgrade -f db5 db6

  This should return portupgrade to normal operation.

20131216:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg, graphics/libGL, graphics/dri, all xorg ports
  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  The default xorg version has been switched on FreeBSD CURRENT.

  To upgrade graphics/libGL, graphics/dri and related MESA ports, it is
  necessary to first remove the old versions of those ports.
  No special upgrade procedure is needed for xorg port but it is
  necessary to recompile all xorg drivers (xf86-*) and other ports that
  depend on the xserver version, including
  emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions.  Portrevisions have been bumped
  where needed, but users of drivers not in the ports tree will need to
  recompile those.

  If it is important to stay on the old versions, it is possible to
  specify WITHOUT_NEW_XORG= in /etc/make.conf to get the old xorg
  distribution.

  To update:

  # pkg_delete -f libGL-\* dri-\*
    or
  # pkg delete -f libGL dri
    followed by
  # portmaster graphics/dri graphics/libGL
    or
  # portupgrade graphics/dri graphics/libGL
    and then
  # portmaster -a
    or
  # portupgrade -a

20131216:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db4*
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Berkeley DB versions before and excluding 4.8 have been marked deprecated.
  New port installations should be based on Berkeley DB 5 or 6.

  Note that Oracle Berkeley DB 6 is under the more restrictive Affero GPL v3
  license, be sure to review if using that fits your requirements.

  You can add WITH_BDB_VER=5 or WITH_BDB_VER=6 to /etc/make.conf to have all
  applications that get rebuilt use Oracle Berkeley DB 5 or 6, respectively.

  DO NOT FORCE DELETE older BerkeleyDB packages, that breaks the upgrade
  tools.  Instead, first rebuild the ports that depend on it, then
  remove the old Berkeley DB versions.

  Berkeley DB ports should be able to build/install with an older and a
  newer version version both installed if WITH_BDB_VER is set.  If a
  port then grabs the old Berkeley DB version, that is an issue with the
  port that requires Berkeley DB, and should be reported to the
  maintainer.

  If you are interested in upgrading now already, we have instructions
  at <https://wiki.freebsd.org/Ports/BerkeleyDBCleanup>.

  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The THREADS option has been enabled by default in all Perl. If you're using
  binary packages you need to do :

    # pkg install -Rf perl5

  If you're not using binary packages, and want to switch from non threaded
  Perl to threaded Perl, you need to recompile and reinstall most ports
  depending on Perl. Supposing you have Perl 5.16, you would do:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Change the option in lang/perl5.16:
        make -C /usr/ports/lang/perl5.16 config

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr lang/perl5.16

  Portmaster users:
    1) Change the option in lang/perl5.16:
        make -C /usr/ports/lang/perl5.16 config

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portmaster -r perl5-

  Note: The installed Perl package was named perl and is now named perl5, if
	you have not updated your installation in a long time, you may need to
	use "perl-" here.

20131112:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/nsd
  AUTHOR: erwin@FreeBSD.org

  dns/nsd was updated to the new 4.0.0 major release.

  This version replaces the nsdc control program with nsd-control.
  This requires some manual setup with nsd-control-setup and editing
  of the config files. nsd-control is incompatible with nsdc so when
  that is used in scripts, these should be adapted.  More information:
  http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/svn/nsd/tags/NSD_4_0_0_REL/doc/NSD-4-features

  NSD version 3 is still supported in dns/nsd3.  To keep the old
  version:
  # portmaster -o dns/nsd3 dns/nsd
    or
  # portupgrade -fo dns/nsd3 dns/nsd
    or
  # pkg set -o dns/nsd:dns/nsd3

  no longer supported out of the box.

  For users of FreeBSD 9.x and earlier, the LINKS option is no longer
  enabled by default, but still supported.  No other changes should
  affect those users, and updating without changing already set options
  will keep the system in the same state.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/python* and ports
  AUTHOR: mva@FreeBSD.org

  The default versions of lang/python* have been changed to support the
  new DEFAULT_VERSIONS variable.

  PYTHON_DEFAULT_VERSION, PYTHON2_DEFAULT_VERSION and
  PYTHON3_DEFAULT_VERSION are deprecated. If you have set them in your
  make.conf, you should change them something like

  DEFAULT_VERSIONS=python=2.7 python2=2.7 python3=3.3

  AFFECTS: users of x11/pixman
  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  The library version of x11/pixman has changed, and PORTREVISION has
  been bumped in all dependent ports.  If you have external software that
  depends on pixman, this software needs to be recompiled.
  To recompile all software dependent on pixman, run:

  # portmaster -r pixman
    or
  # portupgrade -rf pixman

  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  The graphics/libGL, graphics/dri and related MESA ports have been
  updated to 9.1 when compiled with WITH_NEW_XORG= set.  It is necessary
  to remove the old versions of both ports before updating.

  # pkg_delete -f libGL-\* dri-\*
    or
  # pkg delete -f libGL dri

  AFFECTS: Users of ptlib, opal and/or ekiga
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  The ptlib26, opal3 and ekiga3 ports where updated to the latest version
  and moved to the location of the old ports. If the ekiga (2.0) port is
  installed the same line as for ekiga3 can be used except without the 3 at
  the end.

  # portmaster -o devel/ptlib devel/ptlib26
  # portmaster -o net/opal net/opal3
  # portmaster -o net/ekiga3 net-im/ekiga
    or
  # portupgrade -fo devel/ptlib devel/ptlib26
  # portupgrade -fo net/opal net/opal3
  # portupgrade -fo net/ekiga3 net-im/ekiga

  AFFECTS: Users of ports
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  New way to override the default version of a language in the ports
  tree.

  The make variable, DEFAULT_VERSIONS, allows users to override the
  default version defined by the ports tree.

  For example, to declare specific versions for Perl, Ruby and Tcl/Tk,
  it would be defined as:

	DEFAULT_VERSIONS=	perl5=5.18 ruby=2.0 tcltk=8.6

  Today, this only is supported by Perl, Ruby, and Tcl/Tk.

  AFFECTS: Users of ports
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Optional Stack Protector [1] support has been added with the WITH_SSP_PORTS
  knob.

  WITH_SSP_PORTS=	yes

  This currently is only supported on FreeBSD 10 amd64/i386 and earlier
  releases on amd64.

  The default SSP_CLFAGS is -fstack-protector, but -fstack-protector-all
  may optionally be set instead.

  To enable support, add WITH_SSP_PORTS=yes to your make.conf and rebuild all
  ports.

  # portmaster -af
    or
  # portupgrade -af

20130904:
  AFFECTS: 10-CURRENT users with any port depending on converters/libiconv
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  10-CURRENT after r254273 (committed on August 13, 2013) has an
  implementation of iconv enabled by default in libc.

  NOTE: after r341775 (committed on January 29, 2014) and other
  following commits, a few ports, including devel/glib20, depend
  on the converters/libiconv again due to missing functionality in the
  base iconv implementation.

  Due to this change some major overhauling of the ports tree has
  been necessary to move the ports to using that implementation.

  People using pkgng binary packages should have little problems,
  "pkg upgrade" will update all software to not depend on libiconv
  anymore, once updated packages are available. Please make sure to
  perform a "pkg autoremove" after that and check that libiconv is
  correctly removed by it.

  If you are using ports the update requires some manual intervention.
  The following procedure should be followed:

  # pkg query %ro libiconv >ports_to_update
  # pkg delete -f libiconv
  # cat ports_to_update | xargs portmaster

  or:

  # pkg query %ro libiconv >ports_to_update
  # pkg delete -f libiconv
  # cat ports_to_update | xargs portupgrade -f

  AUTHOR: dinoex@FreeBSD.org

  The on disk format has changed.
  Please make sure that queue is empty before you update.

20130817:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/python*
  AUTHOR: mva@FreeBSD.org

  The lang/python* ports do not install links to 2to3, idle, pydoc, python
  and other binaries anymore. Those were moved into the lang/python2 and
  lang/python3 ports respectively. This change brings us closer to the goal
  of making Python ports usable with different Python versions at the same
  time.

  If you have lang/python2* or lang/python3* installed, please also install
  the associated lang/python2 or lang/python3 port.

  1. update lang/python2* and/or lang/python3*
  2. install lang/python2 and/or lang/python3
  3. install/update lang/python

20130816:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/opendx and math/octave-forge-octcdf
  AUTHOR: stephen@FreeBSD.org

  These two ports have changed the science/netcdf dependency to
  science/netcdf4.  It is recommended that the science/netcdf package
  be deinstalled before rebuilding these ports, otherwise you are likely
  to face port conflicts when building future ports.

20130806:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/eric4
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  Since PKGVERSION=4.5.13_1 the default file destination has changed from
  ${PYTHON_SITELIBDIR}/eric4 to ${DATADIR}.

20130731:
  AFFECTS: users of glib20
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  The devel/gio-fam-backend port was removed in the glib 2.36 update.
  Since the gio-fam-backend port was used in USE_GNOME=glib20, all
  dependencies need to be rebuilt. The removal of gio-fam-backend isn't
  critical, glib20 using programs should work just fine if the port is still
  installed. It is not clear however, if glib20 will use the new kqueue
  backend or the old fam backend.

  Note that users of pkg packages can just run the pkg delete command after
  their next update.

  # portmaster -r gio-fam-backend
  # pkg_delete gio-fam-backend-\* (for pkgng: pkg delete gio-fam-backend)
  # portmaster -a

    or

  # portupgrade -rf gio-fam-backend
  # pkg_delete gio-fam-backend-\* (for pkgng: pkg delete gio-fam-backend)
  # portupgrade -a

  AFFECTS: users of Qt 3 and KDE 3
  AUTHOR: rene@FreeBSD.org

  All ports based on Qt 3 (including KDE 3 but also ports which used Qt 3
  as a graphical toolkit) expired on 20130701 because Qt 3 and KDE 3 were
  no longer maintained upstream.  These ports have been removed today.

  Users of KDE 3 are advised to switch to another desktop environment
  provided in the Ports Collection, e.g. KDE 4 or Xfce.

  Users of Qt 3 are advised to upgrade to the Qt 4 counterpart(s).

  AFFECTS: users of net/openafs
  AUTHOR: bjk@FreeBSD.org

  The OpenAFS 1.6.5 release is a security release which requires substantial
  configuration changes to the AFS servers in addition to the software update,
  in order to be fully protected.  The entry for OPENAFS-SA-2013-003 on
  http://www.openafs.org/security/ has links to the upgrade documentation.
  The procedure involves rekeying the cell to a non-DES krb5 key, stored in
  a krb5 keytab named rxkad.keytab in PREFIX/etc/openafs/server/.
