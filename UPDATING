This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

  AFFECTS: users of www/ot-recorder
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  The data directory has moved from /var/spool/owntracks to 
  /var/db/owntracks

  Be sure to stop otrecorder, move the directory, and start otrecorder.

  service ot-recorder stop
  cd /var/spool
  mv owntracks /var/db
  service ot-recorder start

  AFFECTS: users of net-im/py-matrix-synapse
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  The support for Python 2.7 has been dropped with the 1.1.0 release of
  net/py-matrix-synapse.

  Users that still use the Python 2.7 version of net-im/py-matrix-synapse
  should switch to a newer Python version, e.g. 3.6, which is the default
  Python version since April 2019. 

20190717:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/py-borgmatic
  AUTHOR: egypcio@FreeBSD.org

  The default location for borgmatic's configurations changed. We moved it
  from '/etc/borgmatic' to '/usr/local/etc/borgmatic' in order to follow
  recommended standards used on FreeBSD.

20190710:
  AFFECTS: users with DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6 or c6_64 in /etc/make.conf
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  On amd64 adding DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6 to /etc/make.conf made Linux
  infrastructure ports (linux_base-c6 and linux-c6*) install i386 CentOS 6
  packages.  Using c6_64 instead of c6 made them install mixed amd64/i386
  CentOS 6 packages and allowed Linux application ports to install amd64
  binaries when available.  The i386-only configuration was only useful for
  users of x11/nvidia-driver* which didn't provide Linux amd64 emulation
  until recently.

  With x11/nvidia-driver* now supporting Linux amd64 there's no longer a
  need for i386-only Linux on amd64 so DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6 has been
  changed to make Linux infrastructure ports install mixed amd64/i386
  CentOS 6 packages, like c6_64 before, and support for c6_64 has been
  removed.

  Users with DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6 should reinstall linux_base-c6 and
  all packages that depend on it.  A list of dependent packages can be
  obtained with the following command:

    pkg info -r linux_base-c6

  Users with DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6_64 only need to replace c6_64 with
  c6 in /etc/make.conf.

  Users of x11/nvidia-driver* should upgrade to FreeBSD 11.3 or 12.0 if
  they want to run Linux amd64 OpenGL programs.  If you are running an
  older version you may want to postpone installing or updating Linux
  application ports until you find the time to upgrade because application
  ports may install amd64 binaries now.  Infrastructure ports are safe to
  reinstall, and so is x11/nvidia-driver*.

  On i386 nothing has changed.

  AFFECTS: users of www/gitlab-ce
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  You must at first upgrade to version 11.11.5 before you can upgrade
  to version 12.
  Support for MySQL will be dropped with next version.
  Make sure you use at least PostgreSQL version 9.6.
  Follow the normal upgrade manual that can be found here:
  https://gitlab.fechner.net/mfechner/Gitlab-docu/blob/master/update/11.11-12.0-freebsd.md

20190705:
  AFFECTS: users of net/serviio which bought a license for the non-free features
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  Version 2 of serviio needs a new license file. Updating without a new license
  file will disable the non-free features.

20190701:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql56-(server|client)
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The default MySQL version has been updated from 5.6 to 5.7.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 5.6 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep MySQL 5.6 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=mysql=5.6

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  running server instance. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  on installed packages.

  # pkg set -o databases/mysql56-client:databases/mysql57-client
  # pkg set -o databases/mysql56-server:databases/mysql57-server
  # pkg upgrade

20190630:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba410
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  If you used Samba in AD/DC mode with the previous versions of the port on UFS2
  backed storage you have to add usage of vfs_freebsd VFS module for at least
  SYSVOL share and configure it to use 'legacy' mode(see manpage).

  The reason behind this is that previous versions Samba port used a hack to
  workaround broken mapping of Linux security and trusted extended attributes
  into FreeBSD namespace. In particular, essential security.NTACL attribute
  was replaced with the user.NTACL and placed in a insecure USER namespace.

  This port dropped this hack in favor of vfs_freebsd module, which should
  provide more controlled way of such a mapping.

  To maintain the compatibility with the previous installations on UFS2 storage
  (as ZFS uses it's own way of mapping SYSVOL, thanks to the iXsystems patches)
  the vfs_freebsd module provides 'legacy' mode that implements old functionality.

  For the fresh installations it is recommended to use 'secure' mode of operations
  for this module and use it as a global vfs objects.

  Caution: The given module is still considered EXPERIMENTAL.

  AFFECTS: users of net/samba410, net/samba4[6-8] and devel/talloc?, devel/tevent?,
           databases/tdb?, databases/ldb*
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  The port of the new version of Samba 4.10 is introduced. Due necessarily
  to keep backwards compatibility for the legacy samba4[6-8] ports the 
  upgrade procedure is a bit convoluted.

  You are safe to perform fresh new install of samba410 port. In case you
  are upgrading from the previous versions of Samba, please use the
  following procedure:

  0.  Take backups of all the relevant files, in particular PREFIX/etc/smb4.conf
      and /var/db/samba4/ subdirectory. Keep in mind that files there (may)
      have extended attributes, so use appropriate tools to preserve them.

  1a. If you haven't updated Samba between 20190619 and 20190630 then next
      step should be as simple as:

        portmaster -o net/samba410 net/samba48

  1b. If you have been affected by the archiving legacy versions of
      Samba-related libraries for legacy versions of Samba, which happened
      in the given time frame, then you need to reverse operation from the
       20190619 entry:

      for users of portmaster:
        portmaster -o devel/talloc devel/talloc1
        portmaster -o devel/tevent devel/tevent1
        portmaster -o databases/tdb databases/tdb1
        portmaster -o net/samba410 net/samba48

      for users of portupgrade:
        portupgrade -o devel/talloc devel/talloc1
        portupgrade -o devel/tevent devel/tevent1
        portupgrade -o databases/tdb databases/tdb1
        portupgrade -o net/samba410 net/samba48

20190619:
  AFFECTS: users of samba4[6-8] and devel/talloc, devel/tevent, databases/tdb, databases/ldb*
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  To introduce samba410(we deliberately skip samba49 due the complexity of handling)
  and to drop dependency on deprecated Python 2.7, Samba supplementary libraries
  talloc, tevent and tdb were split into current Python 3 compatible versions
  and legacy ones, with the suffix "1".

  Old versions of Samba were changed to depend on the legacy supplementary libraries,
  so if you need to install samba46, samba47 or samba48 over previous Samba
  installations you need to downgrade supplementary libs with the following commands:

  for users of portmaster:
        portmaster -o devel/talloc1 devel/talloc
        portmaster -o devel/tevent1 devel/tevent
        portmaster -o databases/tdb1 databases/tdb
        portmaster -r talloc1

  for users of portupgrade:
        portupgrade -o devel/talloc1 devel/talloc
        portupgrade -o devel/tevent1 devel/tevent
        portupgrade -o databases/tdb1 databases/tdb
        portupgrade -fr devel/talloc1

20190613:
  AFFECTS: users of www/qt5-webengine
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Users that upgrade www/qt5-webengine without using pkg/poudriere might
  experience failures due to conflicts with the installed version of 5.12.2.

  In that case, pkg delete -f the qt5-webengine package before building
  the updated version.

20190611:
  AFFECTS: users of net/routinator
  AUTHOR: rodrigo@FreeBSD.org

  Release 0.4.0 fundamentally changes the command line options for
  running the server and introduces a new way to initialize the local RPKI
  repository used by Routinator.
  If you have been using previous releases, you will likely have to adjust
  your tooling. We apologize for this, but we also feel that the new commands
  are more intuitive and logical.

20190604:
  AFFECTS: users of samba47
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of samba has been switched from 4.7 to 4.8.
  Upgrade instructions:

  For package users having samba47 installed indirectly (as a dependency):
    # pkg upgrade

  For package users having samba47 installed directly (leaf port):
    # pkg upgrade
    # pkg install samba48

  For ports users:
    If you want to keep samba47, add DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= samba=4.7 to make.conf

    If you want to upgrade to samba48, remove samba47:
    # pkg delete -f samba47

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster net/samba48
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall net/samba48
    # portupgrade -a
