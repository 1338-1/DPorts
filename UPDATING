This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/ansible
  AUTHOR: lifanov@FreeBSD.org

  The default value for ansible_python_interpreter has been changed
  to match the upstream /usr/bin/python. If managing FreeBSD systems,
  adjust the hosts database to explicitly set a valid python interpreter:

  [freebsd]
  host1

  [freebsd_vars]
  ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/local/bin/python2.7

  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 2.5 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

20170411:
  AFFECTS: www/firefox
  AUTHOR: gecko@FreeBSD.org

  Firefox 53 or later may fail to build if sem(4) is present (see below)
  because sysconf(3) still consults the old limits. If you don't plan to
  run FreeBSD 8.x or older binaries make sure sem(4) isn't loaded during
  boot or built statically into the kernel.

  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/awesome
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  Awesome Window Manager (x11-wm/awesome) was upgraded to 4.1 and its config
  is not backward compatible with 3.5.  A new port was created to keep 3.5
  version available at x11-wm/awesome3 and it will be available for 6 months
  until users have time to upgrade configuration.

  There are references about what has changed in 4.0 at:

  https://awesomewm.org/apidoc/documentation/89-NEWS.md.html#v4

  And configuration porting tips at:

  https://awesomewm.org/apidoc/documentation/17-porting-tips.md.html#v4

  If you would like to keep using 3.x, please run the collowing command to
  update pkg database:

  # pkg set -n awesome:awesome3
  # pkg set -o x11-wm/awesome:x11-wm/awesome3

20170404:
  AFFECTS: users of Xapian 1.2.x and www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  Xapian has been updated to 1.4.3. The 1.2.x series has been renamed with
  suffix "12". The Perl binding for Xapian 1.4.x is databases/p5-Xapian.
  Since www/ikiwiki depends on Search::Xapian, it stays with Xapian 1.2. 
  If you would like to keep using 1.2, please run the following commands
  to update pkg database:

  xapian-core:
    # pkg set -n xapian-core:xapian-core12
    # pkg set -o databases/xapian-core:databases/xapian-core12

  p5-Search-Xapian:
    # pkg set -n p5-Search-Xapian:p5-Search-Xapian12
    # pkg set -o databases/p5-Search-Xapian:databases/p5-Search-Xapian12

  xapian-bindings:
    # pkg set -n xapian-bindings:xapian-bindings12
    # pkg set -o databases/xapian-bindings:databases/xapian-bindings12

  xapian-omega:
    # pkg set -n xapian-omega:xapian-omega12

20170401:
  AFFECTS: net/samba44, net/samba45, net/samba46 and devel/p5-Parse-Pidl*
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  It turned out that arbitary versions of p5-Parse-Pidl may lead to the
  hard to explain crashes of the Samba server and utilities(in particular
  we suspect it was responsible for the troubles with the DC provisioning).

  So, from now on net/samba* ports use bundled version of Pidl. You need to
  remove external package from the system:

  pkg delete -f p5-Parse-Pidl p5-Parse-Pidl44

20170331:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssh-portable
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  The format of several log messages emitted by the packet code has
  changed to include additional information about the user and
  their authentication state. Software that monitors ssh/sshd logs
  may need to account for these changes. For example:

  Connection closed by user x 1.1.1.1 port 1234 [preauth]
  Connection closed by authenticating user x 10.1.1.1 port 1234 [preauth]
  Connection closed by invalid user x 1.1.1.1 port 1234 [preauth]

  Affected messages include connection closure, timeout, remote
  disconnection, negotiation failure and some other fatal messages
  generated by the packet code.

20170326:
  AFFECTS: users of samba43
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of samba has been switched from 4.3 to 4.4.
  Upgrade instructions:

  For package users having samba43 installed indirectly (as a dependency):
    # pkg upgrade

  For package users having samba43 installed directly (leaf port):
    # pkg upgrade
    # pkg install samba44

  For ports users:
    If you want to keep samba43, add DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= samba=4.3 to make.conf

    If you want to upgrade to samba44, remove samba43 and obsolete packages:
    # pkg delete -f samba36-libsmbclient samba36-nmblookup samba36-smbclient samba36 samba43 p5-Parse-Pidl

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster net/samba44
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall net/samba44
    # portupgrade -a

20170325:
  AFFECTS: net/samba46 and devel/p5-Parse-Pidl
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  New version of Samba port from 4.6 branch is added. Before upgrading please read upgrade notes:

  https://www.samba.org/samba/history/samba-4.6.0.html

  For the vfs_fruit users:

  Users on *BSD must rename the metadata xattr used by vfs_fruit when
  using the default setting "fruit:metadata = netatalk".

  Due to a glitch in the Samba xattr API compatibility layer for FreeBSD and a
  mistake in vfs_fruit, vfs_fruit ended up using the wrong xattr name when
  configured with "fruit:metadata = netatalk" (default). Instead of the correct

  org.netatalk.Metadata

  it used

  netatalk.Metadata

  Starting with Samba 4.6 vfs_fruit will use the correct "org.netatalk.Metadata"
  which means existing installations must rename this xattrs. For this purpose
  Samba now includes a new tool `mvxattr`.

20170325:
  AFFECTS: net/samba45, net/samba46 and devel/p5-Parse-Pidl
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  While new Uses/samba.mk dosen't work well with slave ports to compile devel/p5-Parse-Pidl
  for net/samba45 or net/samba46 you need explicitly set in the /etc/make.conf:

  SAMBA4_PORT=net/samba46

  explicitly. In the future that shouldn't be necessary.

20170321:
  AFFECTS: users of samba36-libsmbclient, samba36-nmblookup samba36-smbclient and samba36
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  The obsolete samba36-libsmbclient, samba36-nmblookup, samba36-smbclient and samba36 packages/ports were removed
  and USES=samba was introduced.
  Upgrade instructions:

  For package users having those ports installed indirectly (as dependencies):
    # pkg upgrade

  For package users having those ports installed directly (leaf ports):
    # pkg upgrade
    # pkg install samba43

  For ports users:
    Choose you samba version, for instance add DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= samba=4.3 to make.conf

    Remove obsolete packages:
    # pkg delete -f samba36-libsmbclient samba36-nmblookup samba36-smbclient samba36

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster net/samba43
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall net/samba43
    # portupgrade -a

20170319:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/pecl-mailparse
  AUTHOR: dbaio@bsd.com.br

  The mail/pecl-mailparse has been upgraded to version 3.0.2, and the new
  version is not compatible with PHP5. If you need PHP5 support, you can
  find version 2.1.6 in mail/pecl-mailparse2.

20170319:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/pecl-yaml
  AUTHOR: dbaio@bsd.com.br

  The pecl-yaml has been upgraded to version 2.0.0, and the new version is
  not compatible with PHP5. If you need PHP5 support, you can find version
  1.3.0 in textproc/pecl-yaml1.

20170316:
  AFFECTS: users of python setuptools
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  The python setuptools ports have been renamed to better match other python ports.
  Ports users need to rename them so that portupgrade and portmaster do not
  get confused.  For example:

    pkg set -n py27-setuptools27:py27-setuptools
    pkg set -o devel/py-setuptools27:devel/py27-setuptools
  or
    pkg set -n py35-setuptools35:py35-setuptools
    pkg set -o devel/py-setuptools35:devel/py35-setuptools

20170312:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/ack
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  ack has been renamed back to p5-ack to match our perl naming. You could
  run the following to update pkg database:

    # pkg set -n ack:p5-ack
    # pkg set -o textproc/ack:textproc/p5-ack

20170311:
  AFFECTS: users of games/tome4 with paid DLCs
  AUTHOR: lifanov@FreeBSD.org

  The Ashes of Urh'Rok and Embers of Rage DLCs have been updated to be
  compatible with changes introduced in ToME 1.5.0. Users of these DLCs
  will need to redownload nd place these in $HOME/.t-engine/4.0/addons.

20170302:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/thunderbird with Lightning
  AUTHOR: cmt@FreeBSD.org

  After changes in the packaging of the Lightning extension, profiles
  using this extension have to be re-created.

20170223:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/mtbl
  AUTHOR: truckman@FreeBSD.org

  There is a libmtbl shared library version bump in mtbl version 1.0.0.
  The affected dependent ports have had PORTREVISION bumps, but you will
  need to rebuild any applications that link to libmtbl.

20170220:
  AFFECTS: sysutils/filebeat sysutils/metricbeat sysutils/packetbeat
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The three elasticsearch beats ports have merged into one single port
  systuils/beats that installs all of the above and some more. The reason is to
  make the port more maintainable and also that the new heartbeat beat would
  conflict with sysutils/heartbeat.

20170220:
  AFFECTS: devel/libevent2
  AUTHOR: jbeich@FreeBSD.org

  libevent2 has been renamed back to libevent as the default version.
  If you manage out of tree ports make sure to run the following:

    # pkg set -n libevent2:libevent
    # pkg set -o devel/libevent2:devel/libevent

20170218:
  AFFECTS: users of Qt 4 and Qt 5
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  Following what is already done in Qt 5, the Qt 4 ports no longer install
  their binaries into ${LOCALBASE}/bin (which is "/usr/local/bin" in most
  cases). Additionally, the "-qt4" suffix has been dropped from the file names
  of the binaries that had it, such as "qmake-qt4".

  The new misc/qtchooser port is now used to choose whether a Qt 4 or Qt 5
  version of a binary such as "moc", "qmake" or "designer" will be used. By
  default, the Qt 5 versions are preferred, but that can be changed by setting
  the QT_SELECT environment variable to "qt4".

  qtchooser also allows one to seamlessly use other Qt installations for those
  binaries, which is particularly beneficial to people working on Qt itself or
  who need their own checkouts.

  See qtchooser(1) for more information on how to configure qtchooser.

20170213:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node*
  AUTHOR: bradleythughes@fastmail.fm

  The BUNDLED_SSL option is now enabled by default on FreeBSD 10, since
  Node.js requires OpenSSL 1.0.2, and FreeBSD 10 is shipped with 1.0.1.

20170213:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/libGL, graphics/libEGL, graphics/libglesv2
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  The workaround for handling conflicting libraries between the
  nvidia-driver, libGL, libEGL and libglesv2 ports was removed. If the
  nvidia-driver port is updated before the other ports, it will remove
  the libraries of said ports. This is a side effect of how the workaround
  worked. If this happens reinstalling the affected port is enough.

  pkg users can run: pkg install -f libGL libEGL libglesv2

20170211:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-server/xorg-server
  AUTHOR: rezny@FreeBSD.org

  Xorg server has been updated to 1.18.4 and autodetection has changed.
  The order in which drivers are now attempted is:
    1) vendor/model specific driver according to PCI IDs
    2) generic modesetting driver which requires a drm driver with KMS
    3) scfb, the generic framebuffer driver
    4) vesa (only if arch is x86)

  This should minimize the need for xorg.conf files. It is recommended to
  load the correct KMS driver (i915kms.ko or radeonkms.ko) via rc.conf,
  i.e. kld_list="i915kms.ko", to ensure correct functionality. Although
  the vendor drivers may attempt to load the correct drm driver, which
  does not always work, the modesetting driver assumes the required KMS
  driver is already loaded and will fail if there is none. The modesetting
  driver is now recommended as an alternative to the Intel driver; the
  performance is comparable and stability is better with modesetting. The
  ATI driver continues to offer better performance than modesetting.

20170203:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl-devel
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The version 2.5.1 bumps the libcrypto, libssl and libtls shared library
  versions. You will have to rebuild all packages that depend on
  libressl-devel. Check the 20160811 libressl entry for more detailed
  guidance on rebuilding.

20170202:
  AFFECTS: users of www/uwsgi
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  The previous disruptive changes to uwsgi for security have been remediated
  through creation of a dedicated uwsgi user/group and utilizing the
  uwsgi feature to set socket ownership. The uwsgi daemon by default now
  has the following properties:

  * Process runs as uwsgi user and group (UID/GID 165)
  * Socket mode is 660, still protecting unauthorized access from "other"
  * Socket ownership is www:www, restoring compatibility

20170130:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/ice, devel/py-ice, devel/php5-ice
  AUTHOR: grembo@FreeBSD.org

  Since __WORDSIZE as defined by <stdint.h> always reports 32 when using
  C++98/03 (unless __STDC_LIMIT_MACROS is set explictly), Ice 3.6.3 used
  "long long" for Int64 instead of "long" on 64-bit platforms by mistake.
  A workaround has been added in version 3.6.3_2 of these three ports,
  requiring to upgrade all of them at the same time and to rebuild all
  custom code that links against them.

20170129:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/motion
  AUTHOR: jhale@FreeBSD.org

  Version 3.x expected the configuration files to reside in:
	${LOCALBASE}/etc
  Version 4.x expects the configuration files to reside in:
	${LOCALBASE}/etc/motion
  This was unfortunately overlooked when the port was updated to 4.x, but it
  has now been fixed to install the default configuration file in the new
  location. The rc script now checks for motion.conf in the new location.

  While you may be able to simply copy your old motion.conf to the new location,
  it is recommended to review ${LOCALBASE}/etc/motion/motion.conf and make
  changes to it based on your old ${LOCALBASE}/etc/motion.conf as some options
  have been added and removed.

  Further, if you use motion with multiple cameras and have
  ${LOCALBASE}/etc/thread[0-9].conf files, they should be moved to
  ${LOCALBASE}/etc/motion as well. These files are deprecated and should be
  renamed to camera[0-9].conf and in motion.conf, lines like:
	thread /usr/local/etc/thread1.conf
  Should be converted to:
	camera /usr/local/etc/motion/camera1.conf

20170127:
  AFFECTS: users of www/uwsgi
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  The default socket mode for uwsgi as 777 is a severe security concern.
  This has been remediated by changing the rc script to default to 600.
  The mode is configurable with rc.conf values: uwsgi_socket_mode="600"
  or for a profile named "www", uwsgi_www_socket_mode="600".

20170121:
  AFFECTS: users of security/tinc
  AUTHOR: dinoex@FreeBSD.org

  this version of tinc requires all nodes in the VPN to be linked with a
  version of OpenSSL or LibreSSL that supports the AES256 and SHA256
  algorithms.


20170120:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql56-server
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  databases/mysql56-server was updated to 5.6.35 which included backported
  rc script changes from the mysql57-server port. This broke mysql_optfile in
  rc.conf and also forced a sample my.cnf if none existed. MySQL has
  some parameters which cannot be changed after a database has been
  created, so this caused MySQL to fail to start.

  This change was reverted in mysql56-server-5.6.35_1

  An additional change was made in mysql56-server-5.6.35_2 to prevent
  automatic loading of a sample my.cnf which was causing issues for
  users who were running without a my.cnf.

20170117:
  AFFECTS: users of EoL'ed FreeBSD versions (<10.3, 11 prior to 11.0)
  AUTHOR: amdmi3@FreeBSD.org

  The ports system will now refuse to build anything if it's run on
  outdated system version. This protects users from unexpected build
  failures after code to support EoL'ed systems is removed from the
  tree. You may define ALLOW_UNSUPPORTED_SYSTEM to override this and
  allow builds, but no support will be provided in case of failures.

20170116:
  AFFECTS: users of java/wildfly10
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  The java/wildfly10 port has been updated to 10.1.0. To complete the
  migration you must copy your existing configuration (directories
  "appclient", "standalone", and "domain") from /usr/local/wildfly-10.0.0
  to /usr/local/wildfly10.

20170115:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/librenms
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  The following is recommended for /var/db/mysql/my.cnf

  NOTE: these are global settings.  Please read this first:

20170109:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby22
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.2 to 2.3.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.2 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.2 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.2

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you use portmaster, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby23 lang/ruby22
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-2.3

  If you use portupgrade, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:

  # pkg delete -f ruby portupgrade
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade install clean
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby22:lang/ruby23
  # portupgrade -x ruby-2.3.\* -fr lang/ruby23

20170102:
  AFFECTS: multimedia/ffmpeg
  AUTHOR: jbeich@FreeBSD.org

  OPTIMIZED_CFLAGS switched to only use vendor optimizations which
  means -ffast-math -fno-finite-math-only are no longer applied. If
  you did like the former behavior consider adding

      # multimedia/ffmpeg/Makefile.local
      OPTIMIZED_CFLAGS_CFLAGS += -ffast-math -fno-finite-math-only

  or

      # /etc/make.conf
      .if ${.CURDIR:M*/multimedia/ffmpeg}

  AFFECTS: users of x11/xfce4-terminal
  AUTHOR: olivierd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 0.8.2.
  Please, don't active the hidden 'MiscSlimTabs' option in
  ~/.config/xfce4/terminal/terminalrc, it requires Gtk+ > 3.20.

20161228:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/mlt
  AUTHOR: avilla@FreeBSD.org

  MLT Qt plugins have been moved to their own ports, mlt-qt4 and
  mlt-qt5. Please, uninstall multimedia/mlt before you update:

  # pkg delete mlt

20161227:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openvpn, security/openvpn-polarssl
  AUTHOR: Matthias Andree <mandree@FreeBSD.org>

  The OpenVPN ports have been updated to the new upstream release v2.4,
  and their predecessors preserved as openvpn23 and openvpn23-polarssl,
  respectively.  Note that for the new v2.4 release, the
  openvpn-polarssl port has been renamed to openvpn-mbedtls to match the
  upstream library's new name.

20161218:
  AFFECTS: users of www/nghttp2
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  nghttp2 has been split into 2 ports: www/libnghttp2 for core library and
  www/nghttp2 for the rest. Please uninstall nghttp2 before you update
  this port.

20161216:
  AFFECTS: mail/thunderbird, www/seamonkey
  AUTHOR: gecko@FreeBSD.org

  ENIGMAIL is no longer provided as part of the ports after upstream
  dropped binary components in 1.9. Go to Tools -> Add-ons Manager
  then type "enigmail" in the search box to install.

20161213:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/skalibs, lang/execline, sysutils/s6
  AUTHOR: Colin Booth <colin-ports@heliocat.net>

  skalibs has undergone a major version bump and compatibility is not
  guaranteed for software with a runtime dependency on
  libskarnet.so.2.3.9.0. This will not affect lang/execline or
  sysutils/s6 as those are statically linked against libskarnet.a.

  execline has undergone a major version bump and compatibility is not
  guaranteed for software with a runtime dependency on
  libexecline.so.2.1.4.5. This will not affect sysutils/s6 as all s6
  programs are statically linked against libexecline.a.

  s6 has undergone a major version bump and compatibility is not
  guaranteed for software with a runtime dependency on
  libs6.so.2.2.4.3. Additionally, s6-applyuidgid and s6-setuidgid
  have moved from $PREFIX/sbin to $PREFIX/bin. Any scripts calling
  those utilities that are not relying on $PATH resolution to find
  them will need to be rewritten.

20161207:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bradleythughes@fastmail.fm

  The www/node port has been updated to node.js v7.2.0, the latest
  upstream release. A new port, www/node6, has been created for the
  v6.x LTS branch. Users wanting to stay on v6.x can replace www/node
  with www/node6 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg set -o www/node:www/node6
    or
  # portmaster -o www/node6 www/node
    or
  # portupgrade -o www/node6 www/node

20161202:
  AFFECTS: Users of textproc/p5-Search-Elasticsearch
  AUTHOR: tj@FreeBSD.org

  As of the 5.01 release of ths package, the client libraries for older
  versions of Elasticsearch have started to be shipped seperately.  If you are

  the textproc/p5-Search-Elasticsearch-Client-* ports.

20161126:
  AFFECTS: Users of security/gpgme-*
  AUTHOR: jhale@FreeBSD.org

  Gpgme has been updated to 1.8.0.

  AFFECTS: Users of graphics/tiff
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  The tiff port was updated to 4.0.7.
  The following tools are removed from this release: bmp2tiff, gif2tiff, ras2tiff, rgb2ycbcr and thumbnail.

20161116:
  AFFECTS: Users of sysutils/bareos-*
  AUTHOR: rand@iteris.com

  Bareos v1.6.x changed the configuration scheme, from one configuration
  file per Bareos component (file daemon, storage daemon, and director)
  to several configuration files, in several directories, for each
  component. See http://doc.bareos.org/master/html/bareos-manual-main-reference.html

  The new scheme will use all files named *.conf in the directory
  hierarchies for each component:

    /usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-dir.d/
    /usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-fd.d/
    /usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-sd.d/

  To retain the old configuration scheme of one file per component add
  appropriate lines such as these to your /etc/rc.conf:

    bareos_dir_config="/usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-dir.conf"
    bareos_fd_config="/usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-fd.conf"
    bareos_sd_config="/usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-sd.conf"

20161113:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libosinfo
  AUTHOR: novel@FreeBSD.org

  The libosinfo port was separated into three different ports
  to follow the upstream split:

   - sysutils/osinfo-db-tools: contains the CLI tools
   - misc/osinfo-db: contains database with OS data
   - devel/libosinfo: the library

  As osinfo-db-tools now ships binaries that previously were
  part of libosinfo, it's required to delete the old libosinfo
  package to prevent conflict because of same files installation:

  # pkg delete libosinfo

  And then install the new version.

20161112:
  AFFECTS: users of security/heimdal
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  Heimdal in the base system and security/heimdal <= 1.5.3_6 use
  Berkeley DB to store principals into /var/heimdal/heimdal.db and
  the database format is version 3 by default.  On the other hand,
  security/heimdal 1.5.3_7 or newer use the newer version of
  Berkeley DB and the database format is version 9.
  These two versions are not compatible with each other.  If there is
  a mismatch between Heimdal utilities and its database format,
  you will get an error like the following:

  # /usr/local/sbin/kadmin -l dump
  BDB0641 __db_meta_setup: /var/heimdal/heimdal.db: unexpected file type or format
  kadmin: hdb_open: opening /var/heimdal/heimdal: Invalid argument

  This mismatch can occur in the following three cases:

  1. You used Heimdal in the base system and switch to use security/heimdal
     after creating /var/db/heimdal.db.

  2. You used security/heimdal >= 1.5.3_7 and switch to use one in the
     base system.

  3. You used security/heimdal < 1.5.3_7 and upgrade it to 1.5.3_7 or later.

  To fix this mismatch, you need to dump contents of heimdal.db and
  rebuild the database by using kadmin(8) utility.

  If you use Heimdal in the base system or older versions of
  security/heimdal, and plan to switch to use
  security/heimdal >= 1.5.3_7, execute the following command
  *after* creating a backup copy of /var/heimdal and installing
  security/heimdal:

  # /usr/bin/kadmin -l dump /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump
  # rm /var/heimdal/heimdal.db
  # /usr/local/sbin/kadmin -l load /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump
  # rm /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump

  The above example assumes security/heimdal is installed into
  /usr/local.  If your base system is compiled with WITHOUT_KERBEROS
  use the following instead:

  # db_dump185-5 /var/heimdal/heimdal.db | db_load-5 /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.new
  # chown 0600 /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.new
  # mv /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.new /var/heimdal/heimdal.db

  db_dump and db_load utilitites are installed by database/db5 as
  dependency of security/heimdal.

  If you want to switch from security/heimdal to Heimdal in the base
  system, use the following:

  # /usr/local/sbin/kadmin -l dump /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump
  # rm /var/heimdal/heimdal.db
  # /usr/bin/kadmin -l load /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump
  # rm /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump

20161105:
  AFFECTS: users of security/heimdal
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  kadmin(8) in heimdal-1.5.3_5 and prior did not create a database
  in /var/heimdal in Berkeley DB format which kdc(8) required.  This
  problem has been fixed in heimdal-1.5.3_6.

  upgrade will do the right thing.  For the other people, assuming you are
  migrating from 5.20 to 5.24, do:

  First, add to /etc/make.conf:

  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=  perl5=5.24

  Portupgrade users:
	portupgrade -o lang/perl5.24 -f lang/perl5.20

	  You can now remove the DEFAULT_VERSIONS line added earlier
	  from /etc/make.conf

	  Then you will need to rebuild everything that uses libperl.so, you
	  can do so with:

	portupgrade -f `pkg shlib -qR libperl.so.5.20`

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.24 lang/perl5.20

	  You can now remove the DEFAULT_VERSIONS line added earlier

  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql96-server
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The default unix user used by the PostgreSQL daemon has changed to
  `postgres' to reflect the long time upstream's convention. Any scripts
  you have using the old `pgsql' unix user should be modified when upgrading to
  PostgreSQL version 9.6. Older versions of PostgreSQL will continue using
  `pgsql' until their end-of-life.

  For users with UTF-8 locales in the database: The ICU patch is *activated by
  default* for the PostgreSQL-9.6 server. For previous versions it was optional
  and default off, but this has changed. Please read the entry here below from
  20160811 and understand the consequences of changing between ICU and system
  locale for database collation (short version: don't). pg_upgrade requires the
  collation method to be the same (or a reindex), while pg_dump/restore does not.

  Also, the default home directory for the postgres user is now
  /var/db/postgres, and the default data directory for PostgreSQL 9.6 is
  /var/db/postgres/data96.

  module to program the display engine of the GPU.

  Users that experience hangs when starting X11 server, or observe

	(II) NVIDIA(0): Validated MetaModes:
	(II) NVIDIA(0):     "NULL"

  messages in their /var/log/Xorg.0.log file should replace ``nvidia''

20160829:
  AFFECTS: users of security/sshguard
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  Sshguard has been updated to 1.7.0. There have been several changes to
  this release. Notably the hosts and ipfilter backends are no longer
  supported. If you need these backends to be supported and you missed
  the survey sent out by upstream I urge you to contact upstream.

  The hosts backend was previously served by security/sshguard directly.
  The additional backends were slave ports with package name suffixes. I
  have opted to keep the master/slave port relationship but not choose a
  specific backend for security/sshguard. Instead it is now a metaport
  which will prompt you for which backend you prefer. If no backend is
  configured it will depend on security/sshguard-ipfw, which is the
  native FreeBSD firewall. This my be surprising to users who depended
  on security/sshguard which only provided hosts/TCP Wrappers blocking,
  but there is no replacement at this time.

  I would also like to document that sshguard no longer accepts the -e
  argument which allowed external scripts to run when sshguard finds a
  match. As a result the null backend can no longer be used to create
  custom blocking functionality; it only serves as a detection backend.

  If the removed backends return due to user demand they will be added
  as slave ports for consistency. I apologize for any inconvenience and
  lack of notice on the deprecation of these features.

  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 2.4 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.
  With this update, the patch for the OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER has been
  removed. This causes issues with a number of ports. Patches for all
  ports for which this issues is known can be found on
  https://wiki.freebsd.org/LibreSSL/Ports#OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

20160811:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresqlNN-server with ICU patch
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The ICU patch is added to the PostgreSQL-9.5 server. Please note that you
  must never change between using the ICU patch and using system locale for
  the same database cluster without REINDEXing all TEXT/VARCHAR columns, or
  dump and restore your database. Failing to do so will result in corrupted
  indexes due to the differences between the locale definitions. ICU will
  always be the better choice for speed and correctness.

  Also, the ICU patch used to support other Unicode encodings than UTF-8,
  but that has been removed due to lack of demand and the complicated testing
  required. If you use another Unicode encoding and rely on ICU for collation,
  please refrain from upgrading the postgresql server and instead contact the
  author named above.

  Now, all you need to do is:

  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=  ssl=libressl

  Valid values are base, openssl, openssl-devel, libressl, and libressl-devel.

  AFFECTS: users of www/node, www/node5, and www/node4
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  node now prefers a few libraries from ports to the versions bundled
  with node. However, node cannot use the libssl from LibreSSL. If you
  are using LibreSSL as your SSL provider, you must enable the
  "BUNDLED_SSL" option when building node.

  AFFECTS: users of textproc/xmlroff
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The library part of xmlroff has been separated into textproc/libfo.
  Remove the installed xmlroff first when upgrading it because older
  xmlroff than 0.6.2_6 have files which libfo installs.  A typical
  error message is the following:

  pkg-static: libfo-0.6.2 conflicts with xmlroff-0.6.2_5 (installs files into the same place).  Problematic file: /usr/local/include/libfo-0.6/libfo/area/fo-area.h

  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql-repmgr
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been repocopied to databases/postgresql-repmgr2 and current
  post has been updated to 3.x series. If anyone is still looking forward
  to use the 2.x please upgrade as following.

  # portmaster -o databases/postgresql-repmgr2 databases/postgresql-repmgr
    or
  # portupgrade -o databases/postgresql-repmgr2 databases/postgresql-repmgr

  Otherwise if you want to move on with 3.x series just use

  # portmaster -r databases/postgresql-repmgr
    or
  # portupgrade -fr databases/postgresql-repmgr

20160605:
  AFFECTS: users of www/h2o
  AUTHOR: junovitch@FreeBSD.org

  File paths no longer have a trailing / appended to them. This enables
  directing specific paths to a file but may break existing configurations.
  Refer to https://h2o.examp1e.net/configure/file_directives.html and
  revise your yaml config appropriately.

20160601:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl-devel
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest "unstable" version of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.
  With this update, the patch for the OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER has been
  removed. This causes issues with a number of ports. Patches for many of
  these issues can be found on
  https://wiki.freebsd.org/LibreSSL/Ports#OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER

  After upgrading to 2.4.0, manually update all packages that depend on
  any of the libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and
  libtls) since the versions of these libraries have changed. Normally,
  you can obtain the list of dependent software by running the following
  command:

  # pkg info -r libressl-devel

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl-devel to avoid
  dangling shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this
  correctly, portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to
  rebuild all dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl-devel
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl-devel

20160527:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/opensmtpd-extras (any of them)
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The invocation for extras has changed. Some extras might fail unless
  you pass all options/arguments separated by quotes:

      filter myfilter dnsbl "-c /var/chroot/dnsbl" "-h my.dnsbl.com"

  Additionally, extras now run in a chroot. Either pass "-C" to skip the
  chroot entirely (not recommended), or put all required config files,
  resolv.conf, and external binaries into the chroot. For example:

      # mkdir -p /var/chroot/dnsbl/etc
      # cp /etc/resolv.conf /var/chroot/dnsbl/etc

      And pass "-c /var/chroot/dnsbl" to the filter.

20160526:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/opensmtpd
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  Due to changes to the rc-script you must stop smtpd prior to upgrading
  mail/opensmtpd to version 5.9.2

  # service smtpd stop

  Then upgrade OpenSMTPD to version 5.9.2.
  Additionally version 5.9.2 changes the file mode bits for two directories.
  To allow existing installations to start successfully you must apply the
  following changes

  # chown -R root:_smtpq /var/spool/smtpd/offline
  # chmod -R 770 /var/spool/smtpd/offline
  # chmod -R 700 /var/spool/smtpd/purge

  After applying the changes, the smtpd daemon can successfully be started.

20160525:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/qtcreator
  AUTHOR: nolden@kde.org

  QBS (Qt Build System) was previously shipped as part of qtcreator, now
  it is independently available as devel/qbs. However, on upgrading
  qtcreator to 3.6.1, the depends will detect qbs through a previously
  installed qtcreator port and will not build/install correctly
  (devel/qbs won't be installed automatically as depends)

  The solution is to pkg remove qtcreator, then building works correctly.

20160523:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db6
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/db6 port has been updated to release 6.2.23.

  This requires manual action in two places:
    1. dependent applications need to be recompiled,
    2. SQL databases, if any, need to be reindexed.

  To obtain a list of ports needing a recompilation,
  the following command should provide it:

  # pkg info -r db6

  Then rebuild db6 and the dependent ports.  For pkg users, this should
  be transparent.

  Portmaster users:
  #  portmaster -r databases/db6
  Portupgrade users:
  #  portupgrade -fr databases/db6

  In order to reindex SQL databases, a db6-upgrade61.sh script is
  provided in ${PREFIX}/bin, if and only if the port's SQL option is
  enabled.  For detailed reindexing instructions, see
  http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_05/html/installation/sqlite_ver61.html
  and note that the FreeBSD port installs the upgrade61.sh script with a
  db6- prefix that you need to add.

20160511:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/clementine-player
  AUTHOR: sbruno@FreeBSD.org

  The audio/clementine-player port has been updated to v1.3.1, the latest
  upstream release.  The music database code now has a hard dependency on
  databases/sqlite having the FTS3_TOKENIZER option enabled.  This has
  been made the default option in databases/sqlite.

  Without this option, clementine-player will crash on startup.

20160510:
  AFFECTS: users of biology/seqan
  AUTHOR: junovitch@FreeBSD.org

  The biology/seqan port has been split into biology/seqan (only the
  library) and biology/seqan-apps for the programs based on SeqAn. Both
  ports are based on version 2.1.1 of the SeqAn repository. There is a new
  biology/seqan1 port with version 1.3 of SeqAn for backwards compatibility,
  but this port will likely be deprecated in the next year so please update
  your software to SeqAn2.

20160505:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bradleythughes@fastmail.fm

  The www/node port has been updated to node.js v6.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. Users of node.js v5.x are encouraged to upgrade as
  soon as possible, as upstream support will end two months from now.

  The www/node5 port has been created to aid users transition. Use one of
  the following commands to continue using node.js v5.x:

  # pkg install node5
    or
  # portmaster -o www/node5 www/node
    or
  # portupgrade -o www/node5 www/node

20160503:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  LibreSSL 2.3 has removed SSLv3 support completely which leads to issues
  with a number of ports. Patches for many of these issues can be found
  on https://wiki.freebsd.org/OpenSSL/No-SSLv3

  After upgrading to 2.3.4, manually update all packages that depend on
  any of the libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and
  libtls) since the versions of these libraries have changed. Normally,
  you can obtain the list of dependent software by running the following
  command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

20160501:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dspam
  AUTHOR: junovitch@FreeBSD.org

  dspam has been modified to no longer run as root:mail by default.
  Existing configuration must be adjusted to reflect using a non-privileged
  port and the /var/run/dspam directory for PID and socket files.  If you
  need dspam to run as root for your mail setup, you can use the SETUID
  config option to enable the old insecure behavior.
