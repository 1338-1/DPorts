This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

20210220:
  AFFECTS: users of math/py-mathics
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  math/py-mathics has been split into several ports, and Mathics Core
  only provides a rudimentary command-line shell called mathics.
  To get the same functionality as in 1.x, you need to install either
  mathicsscript or Mathics-Django.

20210219:
  AFFECTS: users of games/mangband
  AUTHOR: adridg@FreeBSD.org

  The client has updated from 1.1.3 (which has a single public server
  left) to the current 1.5.3 (which has more public servers). If you
  update, you can NOT connect to the old server any more. Remember
  to finish your game before updating.

20210210:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/spotifyd
  AUTHOR: rodrigo@FreeBSD.org

  The configuration format for audio/spotifyd is now TOML, make
  sure to update your configuration file after upgrading the port.
  Look at the sample configuration file for a working example.
  https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd/blob/master/docs/src/config/File.md

20210208:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mailscanner
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  The clamavmodule has finally been removed after a long deprecation
  period.  Please remove all references to it in your mailscanner.conf as
  it will now count as a syntax error and may stop MailScanner starting!

20210204:
  AFFECTS: users of www/unit
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  The default location for NGINX Unit's state directory has changed.  It
  was moved from /usr/local/libexec/unit to /var/db/unit in order to
  avoid write operations on /usr/local filesystem.

20210130:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/opencv-core
  AUTHOR: tcberner@FreeBSD.org

  graphics/opencv-core has been reintegrated into graphics/opencv.
  So there is no longer a circular dependency
     opencv-core -> ffmpeg -> opencv

  If you experience problems updating the packages, try
      pkg delete -f opencv-core

20210124:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  The Django templating language (DTL) is no longer supported for export
  templates.  Please ensure that all export templates use Jinja2 before
  upgrading.

  Also the support for embedded graphs was completely removed and several
  changes to the REST API were made.  Please check the changelogs for
  further details.

20210114:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/matterircd
  AUTHOR: norrland@nullbyte.se

  Commandline switches

  Switched to viper for cmdline parsing, which does not support "short" flags.
  You'll need to use --flag instead of -flag. Eg ./matterircd --debug
  Bridge specific configuration is now only in configuration file. This means
  the following flags have been removed: -restrict,-mmteam,-mmserver,
  -mminsecure,-mmskiptlsverify.
  You can set those in matterircd.toml, see the example file.

  Config changes

  BlacklistUser feature for slack has been renamed to DenyUsers.
  JoinMpImOnTalk feature has been renamed to JoinDM and is available for
  slack/mattermost
  JoinInclude, JoinExclude now support regexp (see matterircd.toml.example)

20210113:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/redis[-devel]
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/redis port has been updated to the recent stable release.
  Users wanting to stay on v5.x can replace databases/redis with
  databases/redis5 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg install databases/redis5
    or
  # portmaster -o databases/redis5 databases/redis
    or
  # portupgrade -o databases/redis5 databases/redis

20210106:
  AFFECTS: mail/dovecot
  AUTHOR: pi@FreeBSD.org

  The VPOPMAIL option was removed, because it was dropped upstream,
  so please check your config before upgrading.

20210106:
  AFFECTS: sysutils/graylog
  AUTHOR: dch@FreeBSD.org

  graylog 4.0 and higher now use a new license, the SSPL. For more
  details, see https://www.graylog.org/post/graylog-v4-0-licensing-sspl

20210102:
  AFFECTS: x11/libexo, XFCE4 desktop users
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  XFCE4 has been updated to version 4.16. Unluckily due to how the
  update works out it interacts badly with a defect in pkg which can
  cause files from the libexo package to be absent after upgrade.

  To avoid the issue, before upgrading all packages, please update
  libexo by itself:

  # pkg upgrade libexo
  # pkg upgrade

  If you have already upgraded and you notice XFCE issues due to
  missing libraries you can recover easily by forcing reinstallation
  of libexo:

  # pkg upgrade -f libexo

  Users upgrading via ports should not be affected.

20201228:
  AFFECTS: www/py-flexget
  AUTHOR: jbeich@FreeBSD.org

  py-flexget (or py37-flexget) has been renamed to flexget.
  "pkg upgrade" doesn't track MOVED file unlike portmaster, so
  provide a hint e.g.,

    $ pkg upgrade -x flexget

  or install again, letting pkg remove the old version

    $ pkg install flexget

20201218:
  AFFECTS: users of www/qt5-webengine
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Users that upgrade www/qt5-webengine without using pkg/poudriere might
  experience failures due to conflicts with the installed version of 5.15.2.

  In that case, pkg delete -f the qt5-webengine package before building
  the updated version.

20201130:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/jpeg
  AUTHOR: rene@FreeBSD.org

  The graphics/jpeg port has been removed in favor of graphics/jpeg-turbo.
  The former port was vulnerable and used an outdated ABI and API.

  Please check your make configuration for JPEG_PORT and remove it or
  set it to "jpeg-turbo" if it is currently set to "jpeg".

20201128:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/cego
  AUTHOR: pi@FreeBSD.org

  Database updates from 2.45.x to 2.46.x require a xml tableset export
  and import, since table structure information has been changed.

20201128:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby26
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.6 to 2.7.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.6 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.6 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.6

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkg, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you do not use pkg, please check entry 20190420.
  The description there should also work for this version.

20201112:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/pushgateway
  AUTHOR: rhurlin@FreeBSD.org

  The v0.10.0 release changes the storage format. v0.10 can read the
  storage format of v0.5--v0.9. It will then persist the new format so
  that a downgrade won't be possible anymore [1].

  For later releases >= v1.0.0 only persistence files created by v0.10+
  are usable. So please, upgrade to v0.10 first to convert existing
  persistence files.

  It is intended to replace v0.10.0 in about four weeks from now (not
  before 2020-12-12) by >= v1.3.0.

  [1] https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway/releases/tag/v0.10.0

20201110:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Changes related to the NetBox configuration:

  1. If in use, LDAP authentication must be enabled by setting
     REMOTE_AUTH_BACKEND to 'netbox.authentication.LDAPBackend'.  (The LDAP
     configuration parameters in ldap_config.py remain unchanged.)

  2. REMOTE_AUTH_DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS now takes a dictionary rather than a
     list.  This is a mapping of permission names to a dictionary of
     constraining attributes, or None.

     For example, ['dcim.add_site', 'dcim.change_site'] would become
     {'dcim.add_site': None, 'dcim.change_site': None}.

  3. Support for the DEFAULT_TIMEOUT parameter under REDIS database
     configuration was removed.  Set RQ_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT as a global
     configuration parameter instead.

  Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20201106:
  AFFECTS: users of www/samdruckerserver
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  If upgrading from < 0.2.4, the database schema has changed.

  Run these scripts to update your database:

  * PostgreSQL/updates-2020.08.28.sql
  * PostgreSQL/procedures.sql

  These scripts are in /usr/local/share/samdrucker/PostgreSQL

20201030:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openvpn
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The security/openvpn port has been updated to v2.5.0, which brings a
  change to the default ciphersuite, which no longer contains BF-CBC.

  Some options have been removed. Also, if you need to support very old (v2.3)
  and unsupported clients or servers, you will need to adjust the
  configuration. For details, see:
  https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/release/2.5/Changes.rst#overview-of-changes-in-25

20201029:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The www/node port has been updated to Node.js v15.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. A new port, www/node14, has been created for the
  v14.x LTS branch. Users wanting to stay on v14.x can replace www/node
  with www/node14 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg install www/node14
    or
  # portmaster -o www/node14 www/node
    or
  # portupgrade -o www/node14 www/node

20201026:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  emulators/qemu has been updated to 5.0.1. Previous 4.2.X branch has
  been repocopied to emulators/qemu42. If someone wants to stick with 4.2.X
  branch please use one of the following command:

  # pkg install emulators/qemu42
    or
  # portmaster -o emulators/qemu42 emulators/qemu
    or
  # portupgrade -o emulators/qemu42 emulators/qemu

20201021:
  AFFECTS: users of www/py-unit
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  The www/py-unit port has been renamed to www/unit-python.

20201012:
  AFFECTS: Users of mesa-dri with VAAPI or VDPAU options
  AUTHOR: manu@FreeBSD.org

  The nondefault options VAAPI and VDPAU were removed from the mesa-dri
  port and two new ports, mesa-gallium-va and mesa-gallium-vdpau now contain
  the necessary libraries for using VAAPI or VDPAU on AMD hardware.

20201012:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libsoup-gnome
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  libsoup-gnome has been merged back into libsoup for people building locally:
  first delete libsoup-gnome before installing the new libsoup

  $ pkg delete -f libsoup-gnome

20201011:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/rundeck3 who use MySQL as database
  AUTHOR: daniel.tihanyi@tetragir.com

  Please note that the MySQL JDBC driver is no longer bundled with Rundeck.
  Please make sure that you migrate to the MariaDB Connector or copy the
  driver yourself. More instructions:

  https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/upgrading/upgrading-to-rundeck-3.3.4.html

20201006:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/tenshi
  AUTHOR: 0mp@FreeBSD.org

  The default location for tenshi's configuration file has changed.  It was
  moved to /usr/local/etc/tenshi/tenshi.conf from /usr/local/etc/tenshi.conf
  in order to follow upstream defaults.

20201002:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/fetchmail beginning with 6.4.12_1
  AUTHOR:  mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Note that if you are using fetchmail in a multi-user setup, i. e. with the
  fetchmail_users (mind the -s!) variable set, the $fetchmail_home_prefix +
  user second-guess work has been replaced by a real lookup of the user's home
  directory. In the majority of configurations, this should not make a
  difference, in some setups, it may open up some flexibility.

  The fetchmail_home_prefix variable is ignored from 6.4.12_1 onwards.

  Also, the rc script redirects its input from /dev/null so that passwords
  will not be interactively queried from an rcfile.  Put passwords into
  the [.]fetchmailrc or into a .netrc file.

20201002:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/modules
  AUTHOR: 0mp@FreeBSD.org

  The upstream developers of the Modules port encourage users to consult
  the MIGRATING document, which describes the major changes occurring between
  versions of Modules. It provides an overview of the new features and changed
  behaviors that will be encountered when upgrading:

  https://modules.readthedocs.io/en/v4.6.0/MIGRATING.html

20200930:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/syslog-ng32[789]
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  rc.conf variables syslog_ng_config and syslog_ng_pid have been replaced
  by syslog_ng_flags and syslog_ng_pidfile respecively, making them
  consistent with the rest of the ports tree. syslog_ng_config and
  syslog_ng_pid will continue to work until syslog-ng331 has been
  released and imported into ports.

20200924:
  AFFECTS: users of net/freeradius3, who need python support
  AUTHOR: zi@FreeBSD.org

  FreeRADIUS 3.x currently uses python 2.7 for rlm_python support, which has
  been deprecated and will be removed from the tree at the end of this year.

  Starting in 3.0.21_2, the PYTHON option has been converted to use python 3.x.

  Users should verify their python scripts are 3.x compatible and upgrade to
  3.0.21_2 (or higher) to bring in python 3.x support.

20200921:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql* and other software using PostgreSQL to run
  AUTHOR: kbowling@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PostgreSQL has been switched from 11 to 12.
  The upgrade procedure can use up twice the space the databases
  currently needs. If you have a big amount of stored data take a
  closer look at the manpage of pg_upgrade for avoidance and/or
  speedup of the upgrade.

  The upgrade instructions consider a basic usage and do not match
  complex scenarios like replication, sharding, or similar.

  Upgrade instructions:

  First stop your PostgreSQL, create PostgreSQL-binaries and backup your data.
  If you have another Version of PostgreSQL installed, for example 11.9, your
  files are named according to this.

  # service postgresql stop
  # pkg create postgresql11-server postgresql11-contrib
  # mkdir /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql11-server-11.9.txz -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql11-contrib-11.9.txz -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # pkg delete -f databases/postgresql11-server databases/postgresql11-contrib databases/postgresql11-client

  Now update PostgreSQL:

    pkg user:
    # pkg install databases/postgresql12-server databases/postgresql12-contrib
    # pkg upgrade

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster databases/postgresql12-server databases/postgresql12-contrib
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall databases/postgresql12-server databases/postgresql12-contrib
    # portupgrade -a

  After installing the new PostgreSQL version you need to convert
  all your databases to new version:

  # su -l postgres -c "/usr/local/bin/initdb --encoding=utf-8 --lc-collate=C -D /var/db/postgres/data12 -U postgres"
  # su -l postgres -c "pg_upgrade -b /tmp/pg-upgrade/usr/local/bin/ -d /var/db/postgres/data11/ -B /usr/local/bin/ -D /var/db/postgres/data12/ -U postgres "

  Now the migration is finished. You can start PostgreSQL again with:

  # service postgresql start

  ATTENTION:
  1) The default user changed from "pgsql" to "postgres" in 11. The migration steps above now assume
     the "postgres" database user and FreeBSD user.
  2) See the updating entry 20190829 if you are updating from a release prior to 11.
  3) If you use non-default initdb options, you have to adjust the initdb-command accordingly

20200918:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/thunderbird
  AUTHOR: cmt@FreeBSD.org

  Thunderbird has been updated to the 78esr series. Thunderbird will
  try to convert old profiles on first start, but conversion may fail
  especially on old profiles. Also, older versions of Thunderbird will
  not be able to use a profile once it has been converted. It is
  strongly recommended to move any ~/.thunderbird folder away before
  starting Thunderbird 78 for the first time, thus creating a new and
  empty profile.
  Also note that OpenPGP functionality has been integrated into Thunderbird,
  obsoleting the Enigmail extension.
  Check https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP for details, and
  especially https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP:Smartcards
  if your private key lives on a smartcard.

20200914:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php72
  AUTHOR: tz@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PHP has been switched from 7.2 to 7.4.

  If you use binary packages you should make a list of php packages
  before running 'pkg upgrade':

  # pkg info php7\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  If you use mod_php72 you need to deinstall it and install mod_php74.

20200811:
  AFFECTS: users of *-emacs26-* packages
  AUTHOR: jrm@FreeBSD.org

  With the release of Emacs version 27.1, the major version of editors/emacs has
  changed from 26 to 27.  This means the names of some dependent packages have
  also changed, so simply running `pkg upgrade` will not upgrade foo-emacs26-x
  to foo-emacs27-x.  To update these packages, run these commands with superuser
  privileges.

  Binary package users:

    # sh
    # for i in $(pkg query -g %n '*-emacs26*'); do \
        nn=$(echo "$i" | sed -e 's/emacs26/emacs27/'); \
        pkg set -yn "$i":"$nn"; \
      done;
    # pkg upgrade

  portmaster users:

    # portmaster -r emacs

20200803:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The default Perl version has been switched to Perl 5.32.  If you are using
  binary packages to upgrade your system, you do not have anything to do, pkg
  upgrade will do the right thing.  For the other people, follow the
  instructions in entry 20161103, it should still be the same.

20200726:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/librenms
  AUTHOR:  dvl@FreeBSD.org

  The %%WWWDIR%%%/logs directory has been relocated to /var/log/librenms/
  via the APP_LOG directive in %%WWWDIR%%%/.env.example - this won't affect
  existing installs, but you are strongly encouraged to update your .env file
  settings and relocate your logs.

  Logs which were going to /var/log/messages and /var/log/librenms/ now only go
  to /var/log/librenms/

20200720:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/librenms
  AUTHOR:  dvl@FreeBSD.org

  As mentioned previously in 20200503 polling via cronjob has been removed as of
  release 1.63 - see
  https://community.librenms.org/t/dropping-support-for-php-7-1-and-python-2/11851

  A database upgrade is required:

     cd /usr/local/www/librenms
     sudo ./lnms migrate

  You must  migrate to the Dispatch Service:
  https://docs.librenms.org/Extensions/Dispatcher-Service/

  You may need to add LIBRENMS_USER to .env (see .env.example).

  These steps should get you running:
  * comment out the crontab entries listed above under PYPOLLER
  * populate %%WWWDIR%%/.env with:
    * APP_KEY - see farther below for how to create
    * NODE_ID - see just below for how to create
    * DB_HOST
    * DB_DATABASE
    * DB_USERNAME
    * DB_PASSWORD
  * you can create a NODE_ID with: php -r 'echo uniqid() . "\n";'
  * sysrc librenms_enable="YES"
  * service librenms start

20200719:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  emulators/qemu has been updated to 4.2.1. Previous 4.1.X branch has
  been repocopied to emulators/qemu41. If someone wants to stick with 4.1.X
  branch please use one of the following command:

  # pkg install emulators/qemu41
    or
  # portmaster -o emulators/qemu41 emulators/qemu
    or
  # portupgrade -o emulators/qemu41 emulators/qemu

20200716:
  AFFECTS: users of shells/bash, shells/bash-static
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  In order to cleanly decouple bash from base, bash now reads `profile` from
  LOCALBASE/etc insead of from /etc. If you are using system wide bash
  configuration in /etc/profile please migrate to LOCALBASE/etc/profile

  # cp /etc/profile /usr/local/etc/profile

  or create a symlink

  # ln -s /etc/profile /usr/local/etc/

  If you encounter the following error, you may have the obsolete
  /lib/libreadline.so.8 lying around after an incomplete base update:

  ld-elf.so.1: Undefined symbol "rl_signal_event_hook" referenced from COPY relocation in /usr/local/bin/bash

  Please refer to to (23.5.6.2) in the FreeBSD Handbook on how to
  safely check for outdated files and libraries:

  https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook/makeworld.html

20200713:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/php7[2-4]-imap
  AUTHOR: tz@FreeBSD.org

  The imap module of PHP was compiled against cclient till now. But this lib is
  unmaintained for over 7 years. When combined with modern OpenSSL there are
  various crashes reported.

  Switching to the fork panda-cclient fixes these issues. Therefore we make the
  usage of Panda cclient the new default. If you want to use the old cclient,
  you need to enable it now!

20200616:
  AFFECTS: users of www/baikal
  AUTHOR: gahr@FreeBSD.org

  The www/baikal has been upated to 0.7.1. With the 0.7.0 release, our
  configuration format was updated to use YAML files. You need to go through
  the installer again but we pre-fill most values with the ones from your old
  installation. We recommend that you make a full backup of your data, as a
  safety measure. Starting with 0.7.0, Baikal stores data in both the Specific
  and the config folders. Keep this in mind when upgrading!

  Known issue:: Upgrading from versions older than 0.6.1 does not work.

20200613:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/libreoffice
  AUTHOR: fluffy@FreeBSD.org

  LibreOffice was updated to 6.4 branch with some critical changes:
  - GTK2 option is obsolete by upstream
  - GTK3 option is not more set by default because of unstable yet and have visual glitches
  - QT5 option is set by default to provide comfy visual style for every user
  - KDE option was renamed to KF5 follows upstream

  Please re-run "make config" to pick up the new defaults

20200610:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The www/node port has been updated to Node.js v14.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. This is a major release, including many significant
  changes. Users are encouraged to read the release announcements before
  upgrading:

  https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v14.0.0/

20200602:
  AFFECTS: users of www/radicale
  AUTHOR: decke@FreeBSD.org

  Migration from radicale 1.x to 2.x requires that you export the storage
  with radicale 1.1.6 before updating.

  Migration instructions are available at:
  https://web.archive.org/web/20190314225402/https://radicale.org/1to2/

20200602:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/py-salt
  AUTHOR: krion@FreeBSD.org

  This port is moved to sysutils/py-salt-2019 and sysutils/py-salt was
  updated to version 3000.

  If you wish to use pysalt-2019 in the future, you might run the
  following command:

  # pkg set -o sysutils/py-salt:sysutils/py-salt-2019
  # pkg upgrade

20200531:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-policyd-spf-python
  AUTHOR:  yasu@utahime.org

  This port is now deprecated because upstream project is superseded by its
  successor. So uninstall this port and install mail/py-spf-engine instead.
  Keep in mind that the path of configuration file is changed from
  ${PREFIX}/etc/postfix-policyd-spf-python/policyd-spf.conf to
  ${PREFIX}/etc/python-policyd-spf/policyd-spf.conf. So you need to move
  it to new location unless you use the default one without changing.

20200526:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mariadb104-client, databases/mariadb104-server
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The ports now add sample configuration files to /usr/local/etc/mysql. You
  must merge your client configuration with the conf.d/client.cnf and your
  server configuration with conf.d/server.cnf.

20200518:
  AFFECTS: users of converters/libiconv
  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  Support for the Japanese specific patches have been discontinued.
  These were previously added in a nondefault ports options, for people who
  needed them.
  If you still need them, it might be possible to create a port of libiconv 1.14
  which includes those patches.

20200517:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/sddm
  AUTHOR: arrowd@FreeBSD.org

  The home directory of sddm user has been moved to /var/lib/sddm. It is advised
  to run following commands as root after updating the package:

    # pw usermod -n sddm -d /var/lib/sddm
    # pwd_mkdb /etc/master.passwd
    # mv /usr/local/etc/sddm/home/state.conf /var/lib/sddm/state.conf
    # rm -rf /usr/local/etc/sddm/home

  Otherwise, SDDM will keep using /usr/local/etc/sddm/home/ as its HOME.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/libphutil, devel/arcanist-lib, devel/phabricator
  AUTHOR: grembo@FreeBSD.org

  Upstream fully deprecated devel/libphutil and merged its functionality
  into devel/arcanist-lib and devel/phabricator. As a result, the
  devel/libphutil port will be removed from the ports tree.

  After upgrading devel/(arcanist-lib|phabricator) to version 20200514, it is
  recommended to remove the orphaned libphutil package by running:

    # pkg delete php\*-libphutil

  Alternatively, 'pkg autoremove' will also work as expected, but might
  remove orphaned packages unrelated to this update.

20200505:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/pidgin-rocketchat
  AUTHOR: tobias.rehbein@web.de

  This port has been turned into a libpurple plugin (net-im/purple-rocketchat)
  to support other libpurple clients than pidgin.

  This also changes some dependencies and you should run the following command
  to prevent pidgin from being autoremoved.

  # mark pidgin as being not automatically installed
  pkg set -A 0 pidgin

20200504:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/hs-xmonad
  AUTHOR:  arrowd@FreeBSD.org

  From now, it is recommended to use "build script" method to compile XMonad
  config. See https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-testing/ for general info and
  port's pkg-message for concrete steps.

20200503:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/librenms
  AUTHOR:  dvl@FreeBSD.org

  Polling via cronjob is deprecated as of release 1.63
  Please see https://community.librenms.org/t/dropping-support-for-php-7-1-and-python-2/11851

  Please migrate to the Dispatch Service:
  https://docs.librenms.org/Extensions/Dispatcher-Service/

  These steps should get you running:
  * comment out the crontab entries listed above under PYPOLLER
  * populate %%WWWDIR%%/.env with:
    * APP_KEY - see farther below for how to create
    * NODE_ID - see just below for how to create
    * DB_HOST
    * DB_DATABASE
    * DB_USERNAME
    * DB_PASSWORD
  * you can create a NODE_ID with: php -r 'echo uniqid() . "\n";'
  * sysrc librenms_enable="YES"
  * service librenms start

  AFFECTS: users of www/phpmyfaq
  AUTHOR: flo@FreeBSD.org

  phpMyFAQ has been updated to 3.0.2, old templates are not compatible with
  this new version. Please see:

  https://www.phpmyfaq.de/docs/3.0#3.4

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/ansible
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  Ansible has been updated to 2.9.7. Please follow the porting guide
  to update the rulesets:

  https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides/porting_guide_2.9.html

  If you wish to stay with 2.8 version, you can switch
  to new sysutils/ansible28 port, which tracks stable 2.8 branch:

  # pkg set -n ansible:ansible28

20200428:
  AFFECTS: x11-servers/xwayland-devel
  AUTHOR: jbeich@FreeBSD.org

  DRI3 is enabled by default since mesa-libs-18.3.2_4, so you no
  longer need to define LIBGL_DRI3_ENABLE in ~/.profile or ~/.login.

  See 20200308 entry for more details.

20200422:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/kyua
  AUTHOR: brooks@FreeBSD.org

  A tests group has been added and the tests user should be a member
  of it by default rather than nobody. You should update your password
  database to match (change the group from 65534 to 977 after updating).

  Please use the following command to do so:

  pw usermod -n tests -g tests

20200408:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssh-portable
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  OpenSSH was upgraded to 8.2p1 on 2020-03-23.

  A restart of sshd is required after upgrade due to an incompatibility
  introduced in 8.2.

  Please see https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.2 for upcoming
  deprecation notices.

20200408
  AFFECTS: users of net/irrd
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  Legacy version of net/irrd has been moved to net/irrd-legacy.
  net/irrd has been upgraded to 4.X branch. If someone wants to stick with
  legacy version then pkg users have to do something like

  # pkg set -o net/irrd:net/irrd-legacy

  For portmaster users
  # portmaster -o net/irrd-legacy net/irrd

  Both of the version can be installed and used concurrently in case there is
  a need for migration

20200403:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-fonts/fontconfig
  AUTHOR: desktop@FreeBSD.org

  Fontconfig 2.13.1 generated .uuid files in the fonts directory which where
  not properly registered to the packages. To clean them up, please execute the
  following command:

  	find /usr/local/share/fonts -type f -name .uuid -delete

20200326:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/sonarqube and devel/sonar-ant-task
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The outdated port devel/sonarqube has moved to
  devel/sonarqube-community to make it clear that it is the community
  edition. The log and DB files are still stored in the same location.

  The devel/sonar-ant-task port has moved to devel/sonarqube-ant-task
  to match the upstream-name. The install location is renamed
  accordingly.

  At the same time the user/group of the sonarqube port changed from
  www:www to sonarqube:sonarqube.

  It is expected that nobody was using the 6.2 version from 2016
  anymore and no change needs to be done. No analysis was done to check
  if the old 6.2 version can be updated in-place to the 8.2 version.
  As such if there is still someone using the old 6.2 version, you may
  have to delete /var/log/sonarqube and /var/db/sonarqube before
  installing the new version.

20200320
  AFFECTS: users of devel/qca
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  New versions of devel/qca stopped supporting OpenSSL < 1.1.
  For this reason devel/qca-legacy has been added, which is
  held back at an older version until FreeBSD 11 goes EOL.

  Ports depending on devel/qca should stop adding direct LIB_DEPENDS
  and switch to depending on it via USES=qca.

  FreeBSD 11 users might want to run something like

      pkg set -o devel/qca:devel/qca-legacy

20200320:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/libxkbcommon
  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  The libxkbcommon library (x11/libxkbcommon), used to handle keyboards
  in some applications, most notably kde and wayland, have been switched
  to use evdev rules by default on FreeBSD 12 and later.  Some keys, most
  notably arrow keys, may not work in applications using libxkbcommon if
  you are using xf86-input-keyboard rather than xf86-input-libinput.
  If you have trouble with the keyboard keys, and if /var/log/Xorg.*.log
  shows that the "kbd" or "keyboard" driver is being used, you need to
  switch to legacy rules by setting the environment variable
  XKB_DEFAULT_RULES to xorg.
  This switch is made to match the default configuration on FreeBSD 12.1 and
  later, the default configuration on FreeBSD 11.3 still uses the legacy
  rules.
