This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/db6
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Oracle BerkeleyDB 6.0 was upgraded to version 6.0.30.  Databases that
  use BLOBs need to be upgraded using db_upgrade-6.0 before they can be
  accessed again. See the manual for details:

  <http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_03/html/api_reference/C/db_upgrade.html>

  Databases that do not use BLOBs are unaffected.

20140521:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mariadb55*
  AUTHOR: grembo@FreeBSD.org

  The mariadb55-client and mariadb55-server port have been changed to
  respect hier(7) and behave like the mysql ports. Therefore mysql-server
  and mysql monitor will refuse to start if my.cnf exists in /etc or
  /etc/mysql.

  In case you're affected, please move /etc/my.cnf to /usr/local/etc and/or
  /etc/mysql/my.cnf to /usr/local/etc/mysql.

20140520:
  AFFECTS: users of security/dropbear
  AUTHOR: ak@FreeBSD.org

  name. Please do the following according to package manager used.

  # portmaster -o lang/gnu-cobol lang/open-cobol
    or
  # portupgrade -fo lang/gnu-cobol lang/open-cobol
    or
  # pkg set -o lang/open-cobol:lang/gnu-cobol

20140506:
  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/portshaker
  AUTHOR: romain@FreeBSD.org

  ports-mgmt/portshaker was updated to avoid creating an aditional 'ports'
  subdirectory when merging to a poudriere_tree without ZFS, so that
  portshaker's default location matches poudriere's default location.

  Users of poudriere on non-ZFS systems should not anymore have to pass extra
  options to poudriere for it to find the ports tree.

20140506:
  AFFECTS: users of security/yassl
  AUTHOR: gahr@FreeBSD.org

  security/yassl was moved to security/cyassl to match the original package
  name.  Please do the following according to package manager used.

  being able to bootstrap itself.  Please deinstall openjdk7 before
  building the new version.

20140427:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/gdal
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  Due to changes in header files, please deinstall gdal first while updating
  from 1.9.x/1.10.x to 1.11.x.

20140420:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba4
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  Samba4 port now re-uses the same logic and startup script as Samba41. So,
  to get net/samba4 runing you need to rename samba4_enable in /etc/rc.conf
  to the samba_sever_enable.

  samba_server_enable="YES"

  Startup script tries it's best to guess which out of samba/nmbd/smbd/winbindd
  daemons have to be started, but you can fine tune this by specifying them in
  rc.conf, just make sure that samba_server_enable is enabled(see entry for 20121022).

20140416:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg graphics/dri graphics/libGL and related ports
  AUTHOR: x11@FreeBSD.org

  The default xorg version has been switched on FreeBSD 10-STABLE and
  FreeBSD 9-STABLE.

  To upgrade graphics/libGL, graphics/dri and related MESA ports, it is
  necessary to first remove the old versions of those ports.
  No special upgrade procedure is needed for xorg ports but it is
  necessary to recompile all xorg drivers (xf86-*) and other ports that
  depend on the xserver version, including
  emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions.  Portrevisions have been bumped
  where needed, but users of drivers not in the ports tree will need to
  recompile those.

  If it is important to stay on the old versions, it is possible to
  specify WITHOUT_NEW_XORG= in /etc/make.conf to get the old xorg
  distribution.

  For users in need of working console when using KMS drivers (intel and
  radeon graphics cards) please use the new vt(9) console driver.
  For more information, see https://wiki.freebsd.org/Graphics and
  https://wiki.freebsd.org/Newcons .

  To update:

  # pkg_delete -f libGL-\* dri-\*
    or
  # pkg delete -f libGL dri
    followed by
  # portmaster graphics/dri graphics/libGL
    or
  # portupgrade graphics/dri graphics/libGL
    and then
  # portmaster -a
    or
  # portupgrade -a

20140416:
  AFFECTS: users of print/freetype2 textproc/libxml2 x11/pixman
           x11/libxcb and graphics/freeglut
  AUTHOR: x11@FreeBSD.org and gnome@FreeBSD.org

  The library version of the above libraries has been brought in line
  with what upstream expects. To do this all users of these ports need
  to be rebuilt. Portrevisions have been bumped as a consequence.

  # portmaster -r freetype2 -r libxml2 -r pixman -r freeglut -r libxcb
  or
  # portupgrade -rf freetype2 libxml2 pixman freeglut libxcb

20140415:
  AFFECTS: Users of mod_python3
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  www/mod_python3 was renamed to www/mod_python33, additional www/mod_python35
  with support for apache24 was added to the portstree.

  To reflect the new port location use:

  pkgng users:
  # pkg set -o www/mod_python3:www/mod_python33

  portmaster users:
  # portmaster -o www/mod_python33 www/mod_python3

  portupgrade users:
  # portugrade -o www/mod_python33 www/mod_python3

20140414:
  AFFECTS: Users of dmd 1.X and dmd 2.x.
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  lang/dmd and lang/dmd2 have switched places. Dmd 1.x is no longer supported
  by digitalmars.com and is now the secondary dmd port in the collection.
  Dmd2 is the primary port. What this means to dmd users is that dmd1 is now
  used to invoke dmd 1.x and the dmd command (instead of dmd2) now invokes
  dmd 2.x.

20140413:
  AFFECTS: Users of Python and pkg >= 1.2.7_1
  AUTHOR: koobs@FreeBSD.org

  There have been reports of the following error when upgrading Python ports:

    pkg-static: Plist error, directory listed as a file: <name>.egg-info

  The cause is an outdated or unpatched version of setuptools or distribute
  installed by the user, or leftover from previous upgrades being used during
  the `setup.py install` phase. pkg >= 1.2.7_1 now generates an error where
  previously it did not.

  Users should inspect their ${LOCALBASE}/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages
  directory, and remove any entries that reference versions of
  setuptools or distribute *not* provided by ports or packages.

  Examples of entries that may be removed are:

    1) distribute-0.6.35-py2.7.egg
    2) setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg
    3) *Any* version of setuptools directly from PyPi via pip or easy_install

  More information is available here:

20140410:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/vpopmail
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  If you are storing limits in MySQL, the following schema changes must be made:

  ALTER TABLE `limits` ADD `disable_maildrop` TINYINT(1) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL AFTER `disable_spamassassin`;
  ALTER TABLE `limits` MODIFY `diskquota` BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
  ALTER TABLE `limits` MODIFY `maxmsgcount` BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
  ALTER TABLE `limits` MODIFY `defaultquota` BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
  ALTER TABLE `limits` MODIFY `defaultmaxmsgcount` BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

20140403:
  AFFECTS: users of net/rabbitmq
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  This release changes the behaviour of the default "guest" user.

  Previously the guest user could be accessed from any network
  location. In RabbitMQ 3.3.0 and later, the guest user can only
  be accessed via localhost by default.

  Any other users you create will not (by default) be restricted
  in this way.

  See http://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html for more information.

20140403:
  AFFECTS: users of net/kdnssd
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC ports have been updated to 4.12.4. kdnssd package has been renamed
  to match upstream naming. pkgng users need to update package origin
  manually:

  # pkg set -o net/kdnssd:net/zeroconf-ioslave

20140402:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/elasticsearch
  AUTHOR: tj@FreeBSD.org

  Elasticsearch has been updated to version 1.1.0. If you are updating
  from a version prior to 1.0.0 you will need to do a full cluster
  shutdown for this update as it can not be performed in a rolling
  fashion.

20140401:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gnutls3
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Libdane support is no longer enabled by default.  Rebuild the port with
  the LIBDANE option if danetool is desired.

20140331:
  AFFECTS: users of print/cups-client and print/cups-image
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  CUPS ports have been updated to version 1.7.1. A file has migrated from
  cups-image port to cups-client. Before upgrading you should force the
  removal of cups-image port, otherwise it will conflict with the new one.

  pkg users:
  # pkg delete -f cups-image\*

  other users:
  # pkg_delete -f cups-image\*

  2. Install/upgrade other cups* packages.

  If cups-filters complains about a missing cups/raster.h include,
  try reinstalling the cups-client package.

20140327:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php5 and lang/php55 with Apache module
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The Apache PHP module has been separated from the main PHP port.
  If you had the APACHE OPTION selected, you have to perform the
  following steps:

  1) update your lang/php* options (i.e. 'make config')
  2) rebuild lang/php* port
  3) install www/mod_php* port

  It is *mandatory* to build both ports with the same DEBUG and ZTS
  options, so if you have a threaded Apache (i.e. worker or event MPM)
  you have to select the ZTS option in lang/php* port.

20140322:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/apr1
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  APR was updated to 1.5.0, BDB requirement was bumped to 48+
  It is necessary to first remove the old version of devel/apr1.

20140312:
  AFFECTS: users of net/openistgt
  AUTHOR: jpaetzel@FreeBSD.org

  Between istgt supporting target reload, and iscsid using CTL there is no
  point to this port.  As such it has been deleted without warning, since
  the support for it is as best questionable.

  pkgng users:

  # pkg set -o net/openistgt:net/istgt

  portmaster users:

  # portmaster -o net/istgt net/openistgt
  # portmaster -r istgt

  portupgrade users:

  # portupgrade -o net/istgt -f net/openistgt
  # portupgrade -fr net/istgt

20140310:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/p5-Mail-SpamAssassin and japanese/p5-Mail-SpamAssassin
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  The port mail/p5-Mail-SpamAssassin was renamed to mail/spamassassin and
  the port japanese/p5-Mail-SpamAssassin was renamed to japanese/spamassassin.

  portmaster users:

  # portmaster -o mail/spamassassin mail/p5-Mail-SpamAssassin
  # portmaster -o japanese/spamassassin japanese/p5-Mail-SpamAssassin

20140307:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/py-setuptools dependent ports
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  devel/py-setuptools is being used for every python ports (if USE_PYDISTUTILS
  defined) since r336553. Due to PKGORIGIN limitation, we cannot build one
  python port with python27 and the other with python33 since they require
  different setuptools versions which have same PKGORIGIN. With the addition
  of py-setuptools{27,32,33}, we could now have py27-foo and py33-bar coexist
  in one system.

  Note that this is only a short-term solution. It does not help if you need
  coexistence of one port with different python versions, e.g. py27-foo and
  py33-foo.

  Please rebuild all ports that depend on devel/py-setuptools and use
  devel/py-setuptools{27,32,33} instead.

  XX represents python version (27, 32 or 33) in the following steps.

  pkgng users:

  # pkg set -o devel/py-setuptools:devel/py-setuptoolsXX

  portmaster users:

  # portmaster -o devel/py-setuptoolsXX devel/py-setuptools
  # portmaster -r py\*setuptools

  portupgrade users:

  # portupgrade -o devel/py-setuptoolsXX -f devel/py-setuptools
  # portupgrade -fr devel/py-setuptools

  will be necessary to remove it before updating.

20140220:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/vim
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  The editors/vim port has been reworked to simplify option handling. In UI
  option group, a new option (CONSOLE) was added for users who do not need
  GUI support. This option is off by default. You might encounter install
  or package failures with "old" option setting. Please run "make config" to
  modify your setting.

20140219:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/docbook*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The textproc/docbook-* ports have been consolidated into two ports
  textproc/docbook-sgml and textproc/docbook-xml.

  Before upgrading you should force the removal of the existing ports, they
  will conflict with the new ones.

  pkg users can run:

    pkg delete -f docbook-xml\* docbook-sk\* docbook\[2345\]\?\?-\* docbook-4\*

  the other users can run:

    pkg_delete -f docbook-xml\* docbook-sk\* docbook\[2345\]\?\?-\* docbook-4\*

  AFFECTS: users of KDE SC 4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC ports have been updated to 4.12.2. kdeadmin, kdenetwork, kdesdk,
  and kdetoys ports have been split due to upstream changes.

  KDE Workspace port has been updated to 4.11.6. It requires modern
  Mesa libraries, provided by WITH_NEW_XORG knob. To update Xorg ports
  to newer version follow instructions at https://wiki.freebsd.org/Graphics

20140218:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/kdehier4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE4_PREFIX has been changed from /usr/local/kde4 to /usr/local.
  All ports that depends on kdehier4 must be reinstalled.
  PORTREVISION for affected ports has been increased, upgrading tools
  (portmaster, pkg) should handle this update without manual intervention.
  Please check /usr/local/kde4 for leftovers after upgrade. If you don't
  have locally modified files, e.g. under /usr/local/kde4/etc, you may
  safely remove /usr/local/kde4.

20140214:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.12
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Perl 5.12 has been removed.  The default Perl is lang/perl5.16.

  pkg(8) users:
    1) Update the origin to point to 5.16:
       pkg set -o lang/perl5.12:lang/perl5.16

    2) Upgrade perl and all dependencies:
       pkg install -Rf lang/perl5.16

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
       pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.16):
       portupgrade -o lang/perl5.16 -f lang/perl5.12

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
       portupgrade -fr lang/perl5.16

  Portmaster users:
    portmaster -o lang/perl5.16 lang/perl5.12

    Conservative:
      portmaster p5-

    Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
      portmaster -r perl-

    Note: If the "perl-" glob matches more than one port specify the name of
      the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.  Also, depending on when
      perl 5.12 was installed last, the prefix may be perl-, perl5- or
      perl5.12-.

20140211:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php* database/postgresql* database/mysql* www/apache*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

20140113:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba41
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  With the introduction of Samba 4.1 corresponding port lost SWAT support
  and made WINBIND support mandatory. As samba4 introduced additional 'samba'
  daemon to the tripplet of nmbd/smbd/winbindd to avoid confusion startup
  script for samba41 was renamed to 'samba_server'. To start the whole band
  up it's enough to add to the rc.conf:

  samba_server_enable="YES"

  The libical port was updated to 1.0.0. Due to the shared library bump
  and the removal of the .la file, all ports that use libical need to be
  rebuilt.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/go
  AUTHOR: jlaffaye@FreeBSD.org

  Third party Go packages installed via the ports tree are no longer installed
  in GOROOT (PREFIX/go) but in a specific path: PREFIX/share/go

  Affected ports had their PORTREVISION bumped.
  To reinstall these packages via the ports tree, it is needed to deinstall
  them first (the build will fail if the `go` command detects that they
  already exists in GOROOT).

  If you are using these third party Go packages for local Go development,
  you have to add this new path to your GOPATH environment variable.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/ruby-bdb or ports-mgmt/portupgrade and databases/db5 or databases/db6
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  databases/db5 and databases/db6 have recently been updated to fix
  bugs. This changed their patchlevel version.

  However, ruby-bdb used to break during the db[56] upgrade due to a bug
  described in <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=184921>.

  THEREFORE, YOU MUST MANUALLY UPGRADE databases/ruby-bdb INDIVIDUALLY
  TO 0.6.6_2 OR NEWER WHEN USING portupgrade AGAINST databases/db[56]
  PORTS. To achieve that, type:

  # portupgrade databases/ruby-bdb
  or
  # portmaster -x 'db*' databases/ruby-bdb

  before proceeding with other upgrades.

  Should you have corrupted the portupgrade databases, or if ruby-bdb
  refuses to work with the upgraded db* port with errors such as "DB
  needs compatible versions of libdb & db.h", then rebuild the ruby-bdb
  port manually, and fix the portupgrade databases:

  # make -C /usr/ports/databases/ruby-bdb all deinstall install clean
  # pkgdb -fu
  # portupgrade -f db5 db6

  This should return portupgrade to normal operation.

20131216:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg, graphics/libGL, graphics/dri, all xorg ports
  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  The default xorg version has been switched on FreeBSD CURRENT.

  To upgrade graphics/libGL, graphics/dri and related MESA ports, it is
  necessary to first remove the old versions of those ports.
  No special upgrade procedure is needed for xorg port but it is
  necessary to recompile all xorg drivers (xf86-*) and other ports that
  depend on the xserver version, including
  emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions.  Portrevisions have been bumped
  where needed, but users of drivers not in the ports tree will need to
  recompile those.

  If it is important to stay on the old versions, it is possible to
  specify WITHOUT_NEW_XORG= in /etc/make.conf to get the old xorg
  distribution.

  To update:

  # pkg_delete -f libGL-\* dri-\*
    or
  # pkg delete -f libGL dri
    followed by
  # portmaster graphics/dri graphics/libGL
    or
  # portupgrade graphics/dri graphics/libGL
    and then
  # portmaster -a
    or
  # portupgrade -a

20131216:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db4*
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Berkeley DB versions before and excluding 4.8 have been marked deprecated.
  New port installations should be based on Berkeley DB 5 or 6.

  Note that Oracle Berkeley DB 6 is under the more restrictive Affero GPL v3
  license, be sure to review if using that fits your requirements.

  You can add WITH_BDB_VER=5 or WITH_BDB_VER=6 to /etc/make.conf to have all
  applications that get rebuilt use Oracle Berkeley DB 5 or 6, respectively.

  DO NOT FORCE DELETE older BerkeleyDB packages, that breaks the upgrade
  tools.  Instead, first rebuild the ports that depend on it, then
  remove the old Berkeley DB versions.

  Berkeley DB ports should be able to build/install with an older and a
  newer version version both installed if WITH_BDB_VER is set.  If a
  port then grabs the old Berkeley DB version, that is an issue with the
  port that requires Berkeley DB, and should be reported to the
  maintainer.

  If you are interested in upgrading now already, we have instructions
  at <https://wiki.freebsd.org/Ports/BerkeleyDBCleanup>.

  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The THREADS option has been enabled by default in all Perl. If you're using
  binary packages you need to do :

    # pkg install -Rf perl5

  If you're not using binary packages, and want to switch from non threaded
  Perl to threaded Perl, you need to recompile and reinstall most ports
  depending on Perl. Supposing you have Perl 5.16, you would do:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Change the option in lang/perl5.16:
        make -C /usr/ports/lang/perl5.16 config

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr lang/perl5.16

  Portmaster users:
    1) Change the option in lang/perl5.16:
        make -C /usr/ports/lang/perl5.16 config

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portmaster -r perl5-

  Note: The installed Perl package was named perl and is now named perl5, if
	you have not updated your installation in a long time, you may need to
	use "perl-" here.

  AFFECTS: users of dns/nsd
  AUTHOR: erwin@FreeBSD.org

  dns/nsd was updated to the new 4.0.0 major release.

  This version replaces the nsdc control program with nsd-control.
  This requires some manual setup with nsd-control-setup and editing
  of the config files. nsd-control is incompatible with nsdc so when
  that is used in scripts, these should be adapted.  More information:
  http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/svn/nsd/tags/NSD_4_0_0_REL/doc/NSD-4-features

  NSD version 3 is still supported in dns/nsd3.  To keep the old
  version:
  # portmaster -o dns/nsd3 dns/nsd
    or
  # portupgrade -fo dns/nsd3 dns/nsd
    or
  # pkg set -o dns/nsd:dns/nsd3

  All bind9 ports have been updated to support FreeBSD 10.x after
  BIND was removed from the base system.  It is now self-contained
  in ${PREFIX}/etc/namedb, and chroot and symlinking options are
  no longer supported out of the box.

  For users of FreeBSD 9.x and earlier, the LINKS option is no longer
  enabled by default, but still supported.  No other changes should
  affect those users, and updating without changing already set options
  will keep the system in the same state.

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr lang/perl5.16

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.16 lang/perl5.14

	Conservative:
	portmaster p5-

	Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
	portmaster -r perl-

  New way to override the default version of a language in the ports
  tree.

  The make variable, DEFAULT_VERSIONS, allows users to override the
  default version defined by the ports tree.

  For example, to declare specific versions for Perl, Ruby and Tcl/Tk,
  it would be defined as:

	DEFAULT_VERSIONS=	perl5=5.18 ruby=2.0 tcltk=8.6

  Today, this only is supported by Perl, Ruby, and Tcl/Tk.

  AFFECTS: 10-CURRENT users with any port depending on converters/libiconv
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  10-CURRENT after r254273 (committed on August 13, 2013) has an
  implementation of iconv enabled by default in libc.

  NOTE: after r341775 (committed on January 29, 2014) and other
  following commits, a few ports, including devel/glib20, depend
  on the devel/libiconv again due to missing functionality in the
  base iconv implementation.

  Due to this change some major overhauling of the ports tree has
  been necessary to move the ports to using that implementation.

  People using pkgng binary packages should have little problems,
  "pkg upgrade" will update all software to not depend on libiconv
  anymore, once updated packages are available. Please make sure to
  perform a "pkg autoremove" after that and check that libiconv is
  correctly removed by it.

  If you are using ports the update requires some manual intervention.
  The following procedure should be followed:

  # pkg query %ro libiconv >ports_to_update
  # pkg delete -f libiconv
  # cat ports_to_update | xargs portmaster

  or:

  # pkg query %ro libiconv >ports_to_update

  of making Python ports usable with different Python versions at the same
  time.

  If you have lang/python2* or lang/python3* installed, please also install
  the associated lang/python2 or lang/python3 port.

  The devel/gio-fam-backend port was removed in the glib 2.36 update.
  Since the gio-fam-backend port was used in USE_GNOME=glib20, all

  critical, glib20 using programs should work just fine if the port is still
  installed. It is not clear however, if glib20 will use the new kqueue
  backend or the old fam backend.

  Note that users of pkg packages can just run the pkg delete command after
  their next update.

  # portmaster -r gio-fam-backend

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/bacula-server, sysutils/bacula-client, sysutils/bacula-bat
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  The configuration files for bacula have been moved to PREFIX/etc/bacula.
  Move your existing configuration files to this directory after
  upgrading.

  AFFECTS: users of security/logcheck
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  The logcheck port now provides a configuration option controlling
  installation of the crontab file. When installing the port interactively,
  the port option is enabled by default to mimic previous behavior.

  When the port is installed non-interactively (BATCH=yes) the crontab
  file *will not* be installed automatically. If the EXAMPLES port option
  is enabled, the crontab file can be installed manually at a later time
  from EXAMPLESDIR/crontab.in.

  AFFECTS: users of www/zend-framework
  AUTHOR: wg@FreeBSD.org

  zend-framework has been updated to 2.2.1 and old 1.12.0 has been copied
  to www/zend-framework1. If you wish to stay with the older version run:

  # portmaster -o www/zend-framework1 www/zend-framework
    or
  # portupgrade -fo www/zend-framework1 www/zend-framework
    or
  # pkg set -o www/zend-framework:www/zend-framework1

20130714:
  AFFECTS: users of net/avahi-gtk
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  Avahi was updated to 0.6.31, due to changes in the avahi-gtk port it will
  be necessary to remove the avahi-gtk port before updating.
  Users of pkg packages can skip this step.

  # pkg_delete -f avahi-gtk\*
    or
  # pkg delete -f avahi-gtk
    followed by
  # portmaster net/avahi-gtk
    or
  # portupgrade net/avahi-gtk

20130711:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/py-ldns
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The dns/py-ldns port now only installs the Python bits, and depends on
  dns/ldns.  Because of that, you cannot just do a regular upgrade, it
  would install dns/ldns overwriting existing files and removing them when
  removing the old version of dns/py-ldns.

  # pkg_delete -f py-ldns-\*
  # cd /usr/ports/dns/py-ldns && make clean && make install clean
    or
  # pkg delete -fg py-ldns-\*
  # pkg install -f dns/py-ldns

  AFFECTS: users of www/ajaxplorer
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Ajaxplorer was updated to 5.0.1. This is a major update and some
  manual intervention may be needed.

  Before upgrading you should preserve the following files in WWWDIR
  (defaults to PREFIX/www/ajaxplorer) if you have customized them:

  conf/bootstrap_conf.php
  conf/bootstrap_context.php
  conf/bootstrap_plugins.php
  conf/bootstrap_repositories.php

  and put them back after the upgrade.

  If you are using a database backend you will need to manually
  update your database table using the sql script the port will
  install at WWWDIR/conf/conf/4.2.3-5.0.0-db-upgrade.sql

  Don't forget to check the documentation about upgrading from
  version 4.x at:
  http://ajaxplorer.info/ajaxplorer-5-0-0:/#Upgrade_from_4X_to_500

  AFFECTS: users of devel/apr1
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  APR was updated to 1.4.8 and APR-util was updated to 1.5.2.

  Please rebuild all ports which are using functions from APR/APR-util
  such as Apache, Subversion, etc.

  # portmaster -r apr
    or
  # portupgrade -r devel/apr1
    or
  # pkg install -fR devel/apr1

  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdelibs4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The KDE Software Compilation 4.10.4 was committed a few days ago, and
  version 4.10.5 was committed today.

  They include better support for using clang as the compiler, but that
  requires recompiling all KDE ports which depend on x11/kdelibs4. Most
  ports which fall into this category are already part of the KDE Software
  Compilation and have been updated to version 4.10.5, but those released
  separately need to be rebuilt manually.

  If you are building your KDE ports with clang, doing the following is
  recommended:

  # portmaster -r kdelibs-4\*
    or
  # portupgrade -fr x11/kdelibs4
    or
  # pkg install -fR x11/kdelibs4

  Alternatively, to avoid rebuilding the ports which are part of the 4.10.5
  update:

  # portmaster -x \*-4.10.5\* -r kdelibs-4\*
    or
  # portupgrade -x \*-4.10.5\* -fr x11/kdelibs4

  Upstream have removed the need for a separate port for the library
  formerly found in comms/tqsllib. Please remove tqsllib before installing
  trustedqsl

  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/portmaster
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Since June 22nd, portmaster no longer relies on 'WITH_PKGNG' to be defined,
  or ports to be checked out to enable pkgng support.

  It now considers whether or not pkg is installed and registered with itself.

  I.e., if this returns data, pkgng is considered in use:

    # pkg info pkg

  It's possible that you may have tested pkgng in the past, ran pkg2ng, and
  never fully committed to it by setting WITH_PKGNG. If this is the case,
  uninstall pkg with pkg_info/pkg_delete and also remove the stale database,
  rm /var/db/pkg/local.sqlite.

  This could manifest itself as portmaster -L showing the wrong versions, or
  portmaster no longer detecting installed packages correctly.

  Note that PORTS still require WITH_PKGNG=yes in make.conf if you are not
  running CURRENT.

20130627:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba36
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  Samba has updated format of it's printing tdbs (ntprinting.tdb, ntforms.tdb,
  ntdrivers.tdb) to include character encoding. When updating from Samba 3.5
  or earlier to Samba 3.6 or 4.0 these tdbs need to be migrated to new registry
  based printing management. This implies also character conversion.

  You have to specify the correct code page for the conversion, see iconv -l.
  The mostly used one is Windows Latin1 which is CP1252.

  You can correctly view the tdb with:

  # net printing dump encoding=CP1252 /path/to/ntprinters.tdb

  or migrate it with e.g.:

  # net printing migrate encoding=CP1252 /path/to/ntprinters.tdb

  If you migrate printers it is suggest to do it in the following order:

  ntforms.tdb
  ntdrivers.tdb
  ntprinting.tdb

  Don't forget to rename, move or delete these files in /var/db/samba after
  the migration.

20130623:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/mikutter003
  AUTHOR: tota@FreeBSD.org

  net-im/mikutter003 has been removed from the ports tree because the
  Twitter API version 1.0 was deprecated on 2013-05-07 and mikutter003,
  which uses the API 1.0, won't work.
  Please consider using net-im/mikutter instead of this.

  1. deinstall mikutter003
  2. upgrade Ruby to 1.9( or later) (see the entry 20130527)
  3. install net-im/mikutter

20130623:
  AFFECTS: users of www/magento
  AUTHOR: melvyn@magemana.nl

  Magento has been updated to 1.7.0.2 on 2013-06-03. With it a stricter file
  system policy is enforced on the port. If you (or your customer) rely heavily
  on Magento Connect via the backend to install extensions, your quickfix is:

  # chown -R www: ${PREFIX}/www/magento
  # chmod -R u+w ${PREFIX}/www/magento

  The more conservative approach:
  # chown -R www: ${PREFIX}/www/magento/app/code/{local,community} \
    ${PREFIX}/www/magento/app/{design,locale} \
    ${PREFIX}/www/magento/{downloader,skin}

  # chmod -R u+w ${PREFIX}/www/magento/app/code/{local,community} \
    ${PREFIX}/www/magento/app/{design,locale} \
    ${PREFIX}/www/magento/{downloader,skin}

  The conservative approach will alert you to extensions that try to write in
  Magento core, while allowing clean extensions to install properly (corner
  cases may exist).

20130619:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  devel/subversion has been upgraded from 1.7.10 to 1.8.0

  If you want to upgrade, and use http/https access to repositories,
  please check, that the SERF option is enabled, as NEON support
  is gone. Also, mod_dontdothat and svnauthz_validate are
  now enabled with one option TOOLS, among other new tools
  and SVNMUCC is enabled always.

  subversion-1.7.x is available as devel/subversion17

  To stay on subversion-1.7.x set in /etc/make.conf
  WITH_SUBVERSION_VER=17
  and use the following command

  # pkg set -o devel/subversion:devel/subversion17
    or
  # portmaster -o devel/subversion17 devel/subversion

20130614:
  AFFECTS: users who set port options in make.conf
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  Configuring options in make.conf using variables like OPTIONS_SET and
  OPTIONS_UNSET now also suppresses the option dialog for those options.
  This means that when building a port the option dialog will only appear if
  there are truly new options that have not been configured before using either
  the dialog or make.conf.  This allows you to set options like DOCS, NLS,
  X11, etc. once for all ports and not have option dialogs pop up if those are
  the only options.  For a list of variables you can set in make.conf to
  control options see Mk/bsd.options.mk.

20130612:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl* and any port that depends on it
  AUTHOR: az@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.12 has been upgraded from version 5.12.4 to 5.12.5
  lang/perl5.14 has been upgraded from version 5.14.2 to 5.14.4
  lang/perl5.16 has been upgraded from version 5.16.2 to 5.16.3

  The directory structure where Perl is installed has also been modified:
  "major.minor" is now used instead of "major.minor.patchlevel".

  The "perl-after-upgrade" script has been removed.

  Please rebuild all Perl ports and all ports that depend on it:

  # portmaster -r perl
    or
  # portupgrade -rf perl
    or
  # pkg install -fR perl

  AFFECTS: users of lang/ghc and */hs-*
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler has been updated to version
  7.6.3 and Haskell Platform to 2013.2.0.0.  Hence it is recommended to
  rebuild or reinstall all the dependent ports by one of the following
  commands:

  # portmaster -w -r ghc
    or
  # portupgrade -fr lang/ghc
    or
  # pkg install -fR lang/ghc

  Note that prefixes used for hs- ports (Cabal packages) have been
  changed to PREFIX/{lib,share,share/doc}/cabal/ghc-GHC_VERSION to
  enable more seamless upgrades in the future.
