To enable spamd you need:

1) add required spamd entries to /etc/services, run command
     %%PREFIX%%/sbin/add-spamd-to-etc-service

2) Enable spamd in /etc/rc.conf with the following line:
   obspamd_enable="YES"
   obspamlogd_enable="YES"

   For PF you can specify a dedicated pflog interface with parameter
   obspamlogd_pflog_if. This interface will be created and removed
   by the rc script of spamlogd.

3) Configuration template is available in %%PREFIX%%/etc/spamd as
   spamd.conf.sample file.  Copy then to spamd.conf file and
   edit to suit your needs.

4) Add following lines to the pf.conf(5)

  table <spamd-white> persist
  no rdr inet proto tcp from <spamd-white> to any \
      port smtp
  rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to any \
      port smtp -> 127.0.0.1 port spamd

FreeBSD only features (not in OpenBSD):
  - sync for spamdb (parameter -Y)
    See %%DOCSDIR%%/ for usage.
